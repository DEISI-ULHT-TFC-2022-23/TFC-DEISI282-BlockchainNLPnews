Wynler specializes in website development, and stands out because they create projects without any code at all.Classic programming provides that the code must be written manually, and this requires time and knowledge of programming languages. However, modern technology allows you to create sites without code. This gives a specialist the opportunity to concentrate on the creative part.What is no-code?No-code (zero-code) is a programming process without writing any code. No-code development is the process of creating applications with a system of objects and links between them on the principle of the constructor: you can customize the system, on-screen forms, processing logic. The blocks of applications and their integrations are already designed and coded, and the code can be generated by artificial intelligence.Among the no-code platforms separately distinguish website builders. They allow users to build sites of different complexity - from landing pages to full-fledged online stores. Obviously, the creation of sites \"without code\" has both positive and negative sides.Pros:Accessibility. No-code platforms are easy to use and allow designers to quickly create websites and applications;  Quickness. Most development is done with a drag-and-drop interface of pre-built modules. This makes the process of creating sites and testing them faster;  Cost-effectiveness. Using no-code platforms allows you to hire fewer professional developers;  Increased productivity. Since sites can be created faster, more time can be allocated to other tasks;  Adaptability. The problem with traditional manual coding is that you can't instantly change functionality, especially without deep knowledge of the programming language you're looking for. In a no-code application, all you have to do is introduce new logic and the changes will be triggered within hours Cons:You need to have a clear idea of the final product. Any no-code platform has limitations, so you need to understand in advance whether they will affect the given functionality of the site or application;  Rigidity of templates. No no-code platform provides an unlimited number of templates and components to build sites;  Difficulty of migration. If a company decides to abandon the original development platform, it will be more difficult to change vendors. Even if he agrees to make the source code available, it will be harder to maintain and update, as the code will not be accompanied by clear instructions and documentation. The demand for no-code grows every year at the same time as the need to implement responsive IT solutions in business. No-code is most popular for developing and testing websites and applications.Such websites are used by organizations in almost any industry: financial services, accounting, human resources, sales and marketing, and customer support and service.\"For 4 years now we have been collecting meanings in pixels, combining the experience of our clients and our digital expertise.\" - Wynler.

(AP) -- Kevin Warren is ready to tackle a new challenge as president and CEO of the Chicago Bears, and he has a big one going from Big Ten commissioner to leading a founding NFL franchise.A new suburban stadium could be on the horizon. The team owns the No. 1 pick in the draft coming off one of the worst seasons in franchise history. And he's looking forward to working with general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.\"It's because of the challenge, the opportunity,\" Warren said Tuesday at his introductory news conference. \"I trust Ryan, I trust Coach Matt that we're going to do things the right way. We're not going to take shortcuts. We're going to build an incredible franchise. I came here to win championships.\"He said he's a \"big believer in challenges\" and wouldn't have wanted the job \"if it were easy.\" He also predicted: \"Greatness is ahead of us. All we need to do now is go and grasp it.\"Warren, who replaces the retiring Ted Phillips, is scheduled to start his new job in April, though chairman George McCaskey said that timeframe could be moved up as long as the Big Ten can make \"a seamless transition.\" He also said Phillips has agreed to stay on past his Feb. 28 retirement date \"to make sure there's a seamless transition here.\"Warren said he's already begun work in his new job. He was hired as Chicago's fifth president and the first from outside the organization last week. He goes from becoming the first Black commissioner of a Power Five conference to the first Black president of the Bears. He is the team's second president that was not part of the Halas-McCaskey family tree, joining Phillips.\"Papa Bear is smiling today,\" McCaskey said, referring to his grandfather and team founder George Halas.Warren's No. 1 task is helping the Bears construct a new enclosed stadium, assuming they finalize the purchase of a 326-acre tract of land in suburban Arlington Heights and decide to move. The Bears hope to close that deal in the first quarter of this year.He also is joining an organization with the No. 1 pick in the draft following one of the worst seasons in franchise history. The Bears went 3-14, the most losses ever for \"The Monsters of the Midway.\"The Bears are going back to their former chain of command, with Poles reporting to Warren. Poles, hired a year ago, had been reporting to McCaskey. But previous general managers were under Phillips.Poles said he's fine with the arrangement and \"fired up\" about working with the team's new president.Warren said becoming an NFL owner is \"not necessarily\" a goal of his. He also insisted he doesn't see this as a steppingstone to being the league's commissioner.\"There's a lot to be done here,\" he said. \"Last thing I can do is to be looking over the horizon at another job. No. If you talk to anyone like in Minnesota I'm totally in, the Big Ten I'm totally in, I'm totally in with the Bears.\"As for leaving the Big Ten?\"I just felt it was the right time,\" he said. \"I had done what I was called there to be able to do.\"Warren, a lawyer and former sports agent, worked in the NFL for more than two decades, doing stints with the St. Louis Rams and Detroit Lions before settling in with Minnesota in 2005. He was the Vikings' chief operating officer from 2015 to 2019, before being hired to replace Jim Delany as Big Ten commissioner.Warren played a big role in Minnesota's construction of U.S. Bank Stadium, which opened in 2016. With its translucent roof and massive glass panels letting in enough light and air to make fans feel as if they're outdoors, the Bears see it as a model for their potential new home. The Bears want to turn the Arlington Heights site, once a jewel of thoroughbred racing, into a different kind of gem, with restaurants, retail and year-round activity -- all for about 5 billion, with some taxpayer help. They plan to pay for their stadium but want taxpayer dollars to cover infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers to develop the site.Warren helped give the Big Ten a coast-to-coast footprint in the nation's largest markets with the announcement in July that Southern California and UCLA will join in 2024. The conference also landed about 7 billion in media rights deals a month later with FOX, CBS and NBC to share the rights to football and basketball games. The contracts go into effect in 2023 and expire in 2030.Warren also drew sharp criticism early in his tenure as Big Ten commissioner when he initially called off 2020 fall football season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that was ultimately reversed with the league playing an abbreviated schedule. Ohio State star Justin Fields -- now Chicago's quarterback -- started a petition that got 280,000 signatures in three days. \"I know if I was in the Big Ten and someone did what I did, yeah, I would've led a revolt to be able to play,\" Warren said.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "normalized_body": "lake forest il ap kevin waren readi tackl new chaleng presid ceo chicago bear big one go big ten comision lead found nfl franchisea new suburban stadium could horizon team own pick draft come one worst season franchis histori he loke forward work gener manag ryan pole coach mat eberflu chaleng oportun waren said tuesday introductori news confer trust ryan trust coach mat go thing right way go take shortcut go build incred franchis came win championship said he big believ chaleng wouldnt want job easi also predict greatn ahead u al ned go grasp waren replac retir ted philip schedul start new job april though chairman georg mccaskey said timefram could move long big ten make seaml transit also said philip agr stay past feb retir date make sure there seaml transit waren said he alreadi begun work new job hire chicago fifth presid first outsid organ last wek goe becom first black comision power five confer first black presid bear team second presid part halasmccaskey famili tre join philip papa bear smile today mccaskey said refer grandfath team founder georg halaswaren task help bear construct new enclos stadium asum final purchas 0acr tract land suburban arlington height decid move bear hope close deal first quarter yearh also join organ pick draft folow one worst season franchis histori bear went lose ever monster midway bear go back former chain comand pole report waren pole hire year ago ben report mccaskey previou gener manag philipspol said he fine arang fire work team new presidentwaren said becom nfl owner necesarili goal also insist doesnt se stepingston leagu comision there lot done said last thing loke horizon anoth job  talk anyon like minesota im totali big ten im totali im totali bear leav big ten felt right time said done cale abl waren lawyer former sport agent work nfl two decad stint st loui ram detroit lion setl minesota vike chief oper ofic hire replac jim delani big ten comisionerwaren play big role minesota construct u bank stadium open transluc rof masiv gla panel lete enough light air make fan fel theyr outdor bear se model potenti new home bear want turn arlington height site jewel thoroughbr race difer kind gem restaur retail yearound activ al bilion taxpay help plan pay stadium want taxpay dolar cover infrastructur cost road sewer develop sitewaren help give big ten coastocoast fotprint nation largest market anounc juli southern california ucla wil join confer also land bilion medium right deal month later fox cb nbc share right fotbal basketb game contract go efect expir 0waren also drew sharp critic earli tenur big ten comision initiali cale fal fotbal season covid0 pandem move ultim revers leagu play abrevi schedul ohio state star justin field chicago quarterback start petit got signatur thre day know big ten someon yeah wouldv led revolt abl play waren saidap nfl"}

However, what many people don't realise is, they could be entitled to a fully fitted central heating system for free.2023 see's a few new changes to the funding measures, and they've now made it easier for some residential areas to claim a heating grant. With the new LA Flex scheme that has just been passed, homeowners with houses that have never had central heating before should automatically qualify. In other areas, households need to also be claiming at least one of the 'qualifying benefits'.

(AP) -- A federal jury in Virginia on Tuesday found mostly in favor of two police officers who were sued by a U.S. Army lieutenant after he was pepper sprayed, struck and handcuffed during a traffic stop. Video of the 2020 incident in the small town of Windsor got millions of views after Caron Nazario filed the federal lawsuit, highlighting fears of mistreatment among Black drivers and raising questions about reasonable police conduct.The jury in federal court in Richmond found former Windsor police officer Joe Gutierrez liable for assault and awarded Nazario 2,685 in compensatory damages, according to attorneys on both sides of the case. The jury also awarded Nazario 1,000 in punitive damages after Windsor police officer Daniel Crocker illegally searched Nazario's SUV, the attorneys said. A federal judge already ruled last year that Crocker was liable for the search. The jury found in favor of Crocker and against Nazario's claims of assault and battery and false imprisonment, the attorneys said. The jury found in favor of Gutierrez regarding the soldier's claims of battery, false imprisonment and illegal search. \"Having now heard all of the evidence and learning the full picture of this case, we believe the jury reached the correct decision,\" one of Crocker's attorneys, Anne Lahren, said in a statement. \"In the present climate, this took a lot of courage and we thank the jury for their service.\" Nazario filed his lawsuit in 2021. Video shows Crocker and Gutierrez pointing handguns at a uniformed Nazario behind the wheel of his Chevy Tahoe at a gas station. The officers repeatedly commanded Nazario to exit his SUV, with Gutierrez warning at one point that Nazario was \"fixing to ride the lightning\" when he didn't get out.Nazario held his hands in the air outside the driver's side window and continually asked why he was being stopped.Nazario also said: \"I'm honestly afraid to get out.\"\"You should be,\" Gutierrez responded.Nazario stayed in the vehicle. Gutierrez went on to pepper spray him through the open window. Once Nazario exited the SUV, the officers commanded him to get on the ground, with Gutierrez using his knees to strike Nazario's legs, the lawsuit states.Nazario has developed anxiety, depression and PTSD, according to his lawsuit. A psychologist also found that Nazario, who is Black and Latino, suffers from race-based trauma associated with violent police encounters, which can exacerbate injuries \"in ways that do not commonly affect the white populations.\"Crocker is still on the force, but Gutierrez was fired in April 2021, the same month Nazario filed his lawsuit.Both Crocker and Gutierrez denied ever threatening to kill Nazario. They contended that Nazario misconstrued Gutierrez's statement that Nazario was \"fixing to ride the lightning.\" Gutierrez spoke those words while holstering his gun and drawing his Taser and was referencing his stun gun, not an execution, according to court filings.Crocker and Gutierrez argued that they performed their duties within the law after Nazario failed to immediately pull over and refused to exit his vehicle. Plus, a federal judge already found they had probable cause to stop Nazario for an improperly displayed license plate, and to charge him with eluding police, as well as obstruction of justice and failure to obey.In August, a special prosecutor determined that Gutierrez should not be criminally charged but should be investigated for potential civil rights violations.U.S. District Judge Roderick C. Young had narrowed the scope of Nazario's lawsuit. Young ruled last year that federal immunity laws shielded Crocker and Gutierrez from Nazario's claims that they violated his constitutional protections against excessive force and unreasonable seizure, as well as Nazario's right to free speech by threatening him with arrest if he complained about their behavior.Nazario was allowed to present claims under state law of false imprisonment and assault and battery to a jury, the judge ruled. The judge also found Crocker liable for illegally searching for a gun in Nazario's SUV, leaving the question of damages on that point to a jury. Nazario had a concealed-carry permit for the weapon.The jury was also asked to consider whether Gutierrez was liable for the illegal search. The former officer denied he knew Crocker was conducting the search.", "normalized_body": "newport news va ap feder juri virginia tuesday found mostli favor two polic ofic su u armi lieuten peper spray struck handcuf trafic stop video incid smal town windsor got milion view caron nazario file feder lawsuit highlight fear mistreat among black driver rais question reason polic conductth juri feder court richmond found former windsor polic ofic joe gutierez liabl asault award nazario compensatori damag acord atorney side case juri also award nazario punit damag windsor polic ofic daniel crocker ilegali search nazario suv atorney said feder judg alreadi rule last year crocker liabl search juri found favor crocker nazario claim asault bateri fals imprison atorney said juri found favor gutierez regard soldier claim bateri fals imprison ileg search heard al evid learn ful pictur case believ juri reach corect decis one crocker atorney ane lahren said statement present climat tok lot courag thank juri servic nazario file lawsuit video show crocker gutierez point handgun uniform nazario behind whel chevi taho ga station ofic repeatedli comand nazario exit suv gutierez warn one point nazario fix ride lightn didnt get outnazario held hand air outsid driver side window continuali ask stopednazario also said im honestli afraid get gutierez respondednazario stay vehicl gutierez went peper spray open window nazario exit suv ofic comand get ground gutierez use kne strike nazario leg lawsuit statesnazario develop anxieti depres ptsd acord lawsuit psychologist also found nazario black latino sufer racebas trauma asoci violent polic encount exacerb injuri way comonli afect white popul crocker stil forc gutierez fire april month nazario file lawsuitboth crocker gutierez deni ever threaten kil nazario contend nazario misconstru gutierez statement nazario fix ride lightn gutierez spoke word holster gun draw taser referenc stun gun execut acord court filingscrock gutierez argu perform duti within law nazario fail imedi pul refus exit vehicl plu feder judg alreadi found probabl caus stop nazario improperli display licens plate charg elud polic wel obstruct justic failur obeyin august special prosecutor determin gutierez criminali charg investig potenti civil right violationsu district judg roderick young narow scope nazario lawsuit young rule last year feder imun law shield crocker gutierez nazario claim violat constitut protect exces forc unreason seizur wel nazario right fre spech threaten arest complain behaviornazario alow present claim state law fals imprison asault bateri juri judg rule judg also found crocker liabl ilegali search gun nazario suv leav question damag point juri nazario concealedcari permit weaponth juri also ask consid whether gutierez liabl ileg search former ofic deni knew crocker conduct search"}

Relax,\" Rivers told reporters. \"It's a guarantee.\"Bold statement, Doc.Rivers laughed as he made the prediction \"with my limited football knowledge,\" but he knew enough to understand the team with the best record in the NFL played across the street.But how far the Eagles go -- and no one in the organization would be so foolish as to make such a bold prognostication as guaranteeing a Super Bowl berth -- depends predominantly on Hurts.And Hurts knows all eyes -- and maybe a few rough shots on his banged-up shoulder -- are on him.\"I've got a bounty on me every week I go out there,\" Hurts said Tuesday. \"I'm going to go out there and just play my game.\"Fans are clamoring to know if Hurts has recovered enough from a sprained right shoulder to play at full strength in an NFC divisional round game Saturday night at Lincoln Financial Field against the New York Giants.\"Full go,\" coach Nick Sirianni said Tuesday.Hurts was not even listed on the Eagles' injury report.Hurts and the Eagles (14-3) enjoyed the spoils of earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC and spent the week scouting -- and snacking -- while the Giants edged out a 31-24 win over the Minnesota Vikings.The Giants were one of four potential opponents the Eagles could have played this week and their game last weekend was on the big screen at Philadelphia's complex while Sirianni reviewed a potential game plan against their NFC East rival.\"We were preparing for the games and did a lot of work on the Giants that day,\" Sirianni said. \"We got it right there.\"In a city that boasts a robust food scene, Sirianni turned some heads when he revealed he ordered stuffed-crust pizzas from Pizza Hut for his coaching staff as they watched the game. Eagles fans might enjoy some gastronomic second-guessing of a coach who has otherwise largely made all the right calls this season.The Giants should know as well as any team how often Sirianni and the Eagles seemingly had everything go right. The NFC East champion Eagles already defeated the Giants twice, 48-22 on Dec. 11 at MetLife Stadium and 22-16 on Jan. 8 in the regular-season finale in Philly. Hurts, who returned for the finale after missing two games because of his bad shoulder, mostly ran a vanilla offense against the Giants' second-teamers.Make it 3-0, and the Eagles will host the NFC championship game.The Eagles went 14-1 in games Hurts started.\"He's better today than he was two weeks ago,\" Sirianni said. \"He's continuing to get better and he feels good.\"Hurts could have added protection against the Giants, with All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson expected to return for the first time since he suffered a torn adductor in a Dec. 24 loss at Dallas. The only starter who might miss a playoff game is cornerback Avonte Maddox (toe), who has not played since he was hurt in the Dallas game.Johnson was a limited participant in a walkthrough practice Tuesday and Maddox did not participate.With the Phillies just three months removed from their unexpected run to the World Series, championship expectations gave gripped the area. Just 80 miles north of the city in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the Kemerer Museum of Decorative Arts moved its \"Alice in Wonderland\" mural unveiling up a week to Feb. 5, saying \"the Philadelphia Eagles have a pretty good shot of making it to the NFL championship game.\"The Eagles hope they'll make a pretty important date just west of Phoenix.The Eagles have made a statement all season that they're the team beat on the road to the Super Bowl. Sirianni and Hurts wore black sweatshirts with the slogan \"It's A Philly\" thing -- several Eagles had the merchandise in their lockers -- in a nod to the ethos ranging from inside the locker room to the street vendors hawking knockoff T-shirts that has enveloped Philadelphia.\"It's a swagger,\" Hurts said. \"It's kind of in the air of its own when you talk the passion in this city, the support in this city. The love for the Philadelphia Eagles in this city is truly a Philly thing. It's a special city, it's a special time. We know we have the support of our city through everything and let's show up on Saturday.\"___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL ", "normalized_body": "philadelphia ap eagl weather smidgen advers lateseason lose streak 0er coach doc river stepe steadi uneas jalen hurt co spiral toward earli postseason exit theyr go super bowl relax river told report guarant bold statement docriv laugh made predict limit fotbal knowledg knew enough understand team best record nfl play acro stretbut far eagl go one organ would folish make bold prognost guarant super bowl berth depend predominantli hurtsand hurt know al eye mayb rough shot bangedup shoulder ive got bounti everi wek go hurt said tuesday im go go play game fan clamor know hurt recov enough sprain right shoulder play ful strength nfc division round game saturday night lincoln financi field new york giant ful go coach nick siriani said tuesdayhurt even list eagl injuri reporthurt eagl enjoy spoil earn sed nfc spent wek scout snack giant edg win minesota vikingsth giant one four potenti opon eagl could play wek game last wekend big scren philadelphia complex siriani review potenti game plan nfc east rival prepar game lot work giant day siriani said got right citi boast robust fod scene siriani turn head reveal order stufedcrust piza piza hut coach staf watch game eagl fan might enjoy gastronom secondgues coach otherwis larg made al right cal seasonth giant know wel team often siriani eagl semingli everyth go right nfc east champion eagl alreadi defeat giant twice dec metlif stadium jan regularseason final phili hurt return final mise two game bad shoulder mostli ran vanila ofens giant secondteamersmak eagl wil host nfc championship gameth eagl went game hurt start he beter today two wek ago siriani said he continu get beter fel god hurt could ade protect giant alpro right tackl lane johnson expect return first time sinc sufer torn aductor dec lo dala starter might mi playof game cornerback avont madox toe play sinc hurt dala gamejohnson limit particip walkthrough practic tuesday madox participatewith phili thre month remov unexpect run world seri championship expect gave gripe area mile north citi bethlehem pensylvania kemer museum decor art move alic wonderland mural unveil wek feb say philadelphia eagl preti god shot make nfl championship game eagl hope theyl make preti import date west phoenixth eagl made statement al season theyr team beat road super bowl siriani hurt wore black sweatshirt slogan phili thing sever eagl merchandis locker nod etho rang insid locker rom stret vendor hawk knockof tshirt envelop philadelphia swager hurt said kind air talk pasion citi suport citi love philadelphia eagl citi truli phili thing special citi special time know suport citi everyth let show saturday ap nfl"}

It will face Roma in the next round.Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka was the only player to miss a penalty as he sent his spot kick wide in the pouring rain at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.It was Ballardini's first match in charge of Cremonese after being hired on Sunday to replace Massimiliano Alvini, who was fired after 11 losses in 18 league matches.Cremonese is in last place in Serie A and faced the runaway league leader, which had beaten Juventus 5-1 on Friday.But it was the visitors which took a surprise lead in the 18th minute when David Okereke raced down the left flank before cutting inside and rolling across for Charles Pickel to slot home.However, Napoli turned it around with two goals in three minutes.Cremonese goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi parried a rocket from Tanguy Ndombele but then went to ground as he attempted to deny Giovanni Simeone, who headed off the crossbar, and Juan Jesus turned in the rebound.There were fierce protests from Cremonese but, after checking with the video assistant referee, the goal was awarded by referee Maria Sole Ferrieri Caputi, who was leading an all-female officiating crew for the first time in a match involving two Serie A teams.Simeone headed Napoli ahead shortly after and it seemed as if the home side was set to ease to victory before a header from Felix Afena-Gyan with three minutes remaining saw Cremonese force extra time.Cremonese's chances of getting anything from the match appeared to diminish when defender Leonardo Sernicola was sent off 10 minutes into extra time following a second yellow card but it held on and emerged victorious from the shootout with Afena-Gyan converting the final penalty.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "normalized_body": "napl itali ap two day apoint coach david balardini stere side huge upset 0man cremones elimin napoli italian cup tuesdaycremones penalti shotout play extra time men match finish wil face rom next roundnapoli midfield stanislav lobotka player mi penalti sent spot kick wide pour rain stadio diego armando maradonait balardini first match charg cremones hire sunday replac masimiliano alvini fire lose leagu matchescremones last place seri face runaway leagu leader beaten juventu fridaybut visitor tok surpris lead 0th minut david okerek race left flank cute insid role acro charl pickel slot homehowev napoli turn around two goal thre minutescremones goalkep marco carnesechi pari rocket tanguy ndombel went ground atempt deni giovani simeon head crosbar juan jesu turn reboundther fierc protest cremones check video asist refer goal award refer maria sole ferieri caputi lead alfemal ofici crew first time match involv two seri teamssimeon head napoli ahead shortli seme home side set ea victori header felix afenagyan thre minut remain saw cremones forc extra timecremones chanc gete anyth match apear diminish defend leonardo sernicola sent minut extra time folow second yelow card held emerg victori shotout afenagyan convert final penaltymor ap socer"}

Shareholders are entitled to redeem shares of the Company at a price equal to 100 of the Average Net Asset Value (NAV) of the three trading days preceding the March 31, 2023 redemption date, less direct costs. Direct costs are expected to be less than 1. If all redemption requests exceed 10 of the aggregate outstanding shares of the Company on March 10, 2023, the final day to submit shares for redemption, the Company will process redemptions to this maximum on a pro-rata basis based on the total number of shares tendered. Payment for shares that have been tendered and accepted for redemption will be made on or before April 21, 2023.Shareholders wishing to redeem their shares must provide notice of their intent to do so with their investment advisor or brokerage office no later than 5pm Eastern time on March 10, 2023. Please note that investment firms may impose an earlier deadline in order to facilitate the processing of redemption requests. Shareholders are strongly urged to consult their investment advisor or brokerage office directly to confirm their internal deadlines. Registered shareholders (those who hold a physical share certificate in their name) should contact the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, at 1-800-564-6253 to redeem their shares. Shares that have been submitted for redemption will remain eligible for the March 2023 distribution, which will be paid in March 2023.Key DatesChange in Monthly DistributionThe Company also announces that it will pay a monthly distribution of CAD 1.75 cents per share commencing with the distribution to be declared in February 2023, representing a reduction in distribution from the current rate of CAD 2.25 cents per share per month. The Company intends to maintain this distribution level for at least the next 12 months unless there are significant and unforeseen changes in market conditions or an economic shock. The reduced distribution rate, as of January 13, 2023, equates to a distribution rate of approximately 6.7 on NAV, or 7.9 on market prices.The current reduction in distribution takes into account many factors, including, but not limited to, the Company's current and expected earnings and the Investment Manager's economic and market outlook. For comparative purposes, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's blended benchmark has a running yield of approximately 4.2, while the global high yield indices have a running yield of approximately 6.2.The investment objective of the Company is to obtain current income. The Company may also achieve incidental capital appreciation. The dividend policy of the Company's Board of Directors is to provide investors with a stable monthly distribution out of net investment income and realized capital gains supplemented with return of capital as required.As a reminder, Singapore legislation does not provide for paid-in capital or par value. The full amount of all dividends paid by the Company are treated as income for Canadian income tax purposes.Investment Manager's OutlookThe Company's portfolio is managed by abrdn Asia Limited (the \"Investment Manager\") and sub-advised by abrdn Investments Limited.Following a very challenging period for bond markets, the outlook in 2023 is more constructive; especially as central banks draw closer to the end of their tightening process, and in the Asian region, as China begins to ease its strict zero-COVID restrictions.We believe three factors will underpin support for Asian and emerging markets fixed income markets in 2023: a more stable global macro environment; inexpensive valuations in currencies, domestic rates and credit; and light positioning.Important InformationPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Chicago-based airline said it is seeing strong demand for flights extending into into the new year, which will help the company cover expected increases in labor costs as it negotiates new union contracts.United predicted that its first-quarter earnings per share will easily top analysts' expectations. Its stock rose modestly, less than 2, in after-market trading.The report from United comes on the heels of upbeat comments by its closest rivals, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. Officials with all three carriers say that consumers are still booking travel despite concern about the economy -- tech companies in particular have been laying off workers -- and high inflation.Airline tickets are contributing to inflation. In December, they cost 28.5 more than a year earlier, according to government figures. United passengers paid on average 25.5 more per mile than a year ago, and 20.8 more than in late 2019.Those higher fares are due to strong demand and a limited number of flights as airlines continue to rebuild operations that were slashed after the pandemic devastated air travel.United said in a regulatory filing that the number of flights this year will be held down by a pilot shortage, the need to keep bigger staffs as a cushion against COVID-10 sick calls, delays in getting new planes, and technology limits. Most major airlines say they are fully staffed now, although they are catching up on training thousands of new workers, including pilots.United said its fourth-quarter profit worked out to 2.46 per share after excluding certain items. That beat Wall Street's mean forecast of 2.11 per share in adjusted profit, according to a survey by FactSet. Revenue was 12.4 billion.For the first quarter, United is projecting profit of 50 cents to 1 per share, which would exceed the analysts' forecast of 31 cents per share. United said it will earn 10 to 12 per share for all of 2023, which would handily beat Wall Street's expectation of 6.84.Company officials were scheduled to hold a call with analysts on Wednesday.Delta reported last week that it made 828 million in the fourth quarter, but it gave a disappointing outlook for first-quarter profit because, it said, it included the potential cost of a new contract with pilots that -- if ratified in the weeks ahead -- would be retroactive to Jan. 1.Also last week, American Airlines raised expectations for results that it will post on Jan. 26.", "normalized_body": "unit airlin report fourthquart profit revenu higher wal stret expect gave bulish forecast asum peopl wil kep travel despit inflat concern economyaft stock market close tuesday unit said earn milion quarter chicagobas airlin said se strong demand flight extend new year wil help compani cover expect increas labor cost negoti new union contractsunit predict firstquart earn per share wil easili top analyst expect stock rose modestli le aftermarket tradingth report unit come hel upbeat coment closest rival delta air line american airlin ofici al thre carier say consum stil boke travel despit concern economi tech compani particular ben lay worker high inflationairlin ticket contribut inflat decemb cost year earlier acord govern figur unit paseng paid averag per mile year ago late 0those higher fare due strong demand limit number flight airlin continu rebuild oper slash pandem devast air travelunit said regulatori file number flight year wil held pilot shortag ned kep biger staf cushion covid0 sick cal delay gete new plane technolog limit major airlin say fuli stafe although catch train thousand new worker includ pilotsunit said fourthquart profit work per share exclud certain item beat wal stret mean forecast per share adjust profit acord survey factset revenu bilionfor first quarter unit project profit cent per share would exc analyst forecast cent per share unit said wil earn per share al would handili beat wal stret expect 0compani ofici schedul hold cal analyst wednesdaydelta report last wek made milion fourth quarter gave disapoint outlok firstquart profit said includ potenti cost new contract pilot ratifi wek ahead would retroact jan 0also last wek american airlin rais expect result wil post jan"}

The child was allegedly beaten to death and buried by one of her caregivers, Ivon Adams, according to court documents released earlier Tuesday.A postal carrier discovered the girl's 5-year-old sister alone on Jan. 10 outside the home where they lived with Adams and his wife, Alysia Adams, in Cyril, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southwest of Oklahoma City.Alysia Adams later told investigators that Ivon Adams beat the child at about midnight Dec. 25, according to an affidavit for the arrest of Ivon Adams. Athena \"was not moving and her eyes were barely open\" Alysia Adams said, according to the affidavit by OSBI Lt. Brenna Alvarez. Ivon Adams \"then laid her on the ground and punched her at least three more times in the chest\" and the child \"never moved after that.\"The document does not reveal why Ivon Adams was beating the girl.Ivon Adams left the home with Athena at about 1 a.m. Dec. 26 and later returned, saying he buried her body on land the Adams once owned near Rush Springs, marking the site with \"a large broken branch.\"Ivon Adams has been charged with murder and child neglect and Alysia Adams has been charged with two counts of child neglect in the case.Court documents do not list attorneys who could speak for either of the Adams. The search for the child turned to a \"recovery operation,\" the OSBI said Monday.Ivon Adams, 36, was arrested last week in Arizona on murder and child neglect charges and awaits extradition. Alysia Adams, 31, is jailed in Oklahoma on child neglect charges after also being arrested last week. Ivon Adams has waived extradition to Oklahoma and remains jailed in Maricopa County, Arizona, pending extradition.\"I want to get there and take care of it,\" Adams told a judge during a hearing Friday in Maricopa County court. \"I need to get there and fight this.\"Brandon Bryant, who said he and his wife were once neighbors of the Adams, said Tuesday that he had little interaction with the couple, but saw nothing unusual from them.\"Didn't see anything out of the normal. We talked to Alysia a few times, Ivon never,\" Bryant said. \"We never went into their house. Alysia came over to our house a few times ... we gave her a car seat.\"Bryant, whose children are 5 and 10 years old, said he still considers Cyril, with a population of about 800, a safe place.\"Its a small town. It's probably one of the few places on earth I would consider leaving my doors unlocked at night ... it's still a good place to live,\" Bryant said.The OSBI has said the girls and the Adams are related. The affidavit said the children's biological mother had left them with the couple 1 1/2 to 2 years ago, and that the girls called Alysia \"mom\" or \"Aly\" and Ivon \"dad\" or \"Uncle Ivon.\"The children's biological mother and father are cooperating with investigators, according to the OSBI.", "normalized_body": "author search bodi mise 0yearold oklahoma girl found remain child yet identifi athena brownfield author say beaten death christma night oklahoma state bureau investig said tuesday remain wil transport medic examin ofic oklahoma citi posit identif acord osbi statement activ homicid investig remain posit identifi osbi wil coment osbi spokesperson return mesag asoci pre comentth remain found near rush spring mile kilomet oklahoma comun cyril athena brownfield report mise child alegedli beaten death buri one caregiv ivon adam acord court document releas earlier tuesdaya postal carier discov girl 0yearold sister alon jan outsid home live adam wife alysia adam cyril mile kilomet southwest oklahoma cityalysia adam later told investig ivon adam beat child midnight dec acord afidavit arest ivon adam athena move eye bare open alysia adam said acord afidavit osbi lt brena alvarez ivon adam laid ground punch least thre time chest child never move document reveal ivon adam beat girlivon adam left home athena dec later return say buri bodi land adam own near rush spring mark site larg broken branch ivon adam ben charg murder child neglect alysia adam ben charg two count child neglect casecourt document list atorney could speak either adam search child turn recoveri oper osbi said mondayivon adam arest last wek arizona murder child neglect charg await extradit alysia adam jail oklahoma child neglect charg also arest last wek ivon adam waiv extradit oklahoma remain jail maricopa counti arizona pend extradit want get take care adam told judg hear friday maricopa counti court ned get fight brandon bryant said wife neighbor adam said tuesday litl interact coupl saw noth unusu didnt se anyth normal talk alysia time ivon never bryant said never went hous alysia came hous time gave car seat bryant whose child year old said stil consid cyril popul safe place smal town probabl one place earth would consid leav dor unlock night stil god place live bryant saidth osbi said girl adam relat afidavit said child biolog mother left coupl year ago girl cale alysia mom ali ivon dad uncl ivon child biolog mother father coper investig acord osbi"}

Everton, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Brentford, Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa were knocked out in their first match in the famous old competition this season.The FA Cup likely represents Liverpool's only chance of a domestic trophy this season, with Klopp's team having exited the League Cup and plunged to ninth place in the league -- 19 points off leader Arsenal.It was a first clean sheet in an away match in a domestic competition since September and came against the lowest-scoring team in the Premier League, with Wolves having only netted 12 goals in 19 league games this season.\"It feels like ages ago we had a feeling of winning and playing well,\" Klopp said. \"We had to fight hard at the end which we controlled for long periods. It is great and the reaction we wanted to see.\"Brighton will host Liverpool in the fourth round on Jan. 29.NO SHOCKFifth-tier Chesterfield was looking to become the second non-league team, after Wrexham and its Hollywood owners, to reach the fourth round.However, there was no shock at The Hawthorns as second-tier West Bromwich Albion easily won 4-0.Fellow Championship teams Luton and Birmingham also advanced Tuesday.Another non-league team, Boreham Wood, was scheduled to play but its replay against third-tier Accrington Stanley was postponed because of a frozen pitch.

(AP) -- New Jersey's gambling revenue matched its all-time high of 5.2 billion in 2022, but only half that amount was won by casinos from in-person gamblers.Figures released Tuesday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos, the horse tracks that take sports bets, and online partners of both types of gambling won 5.21 billion last year, up 10 from a year earlier and matching a level last seen in 2006. That was just before the advent of casino gambling in neighboring Pennsylvania sent New Jersey's gambling industry into a downward spiral that eventually led to the closures of five of the 12 casinos that were operating at the time.But the 2022 number was reached with a hefty assist from internet gambling and sports betting -- revenue streams that help contribute to the bottom line but are also heavily shared with third parties such as sports books and tech platforms.Sarah Grady, assistant director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said it took an enormous amount of work by the casinos and state government to replicate the levels of 2006, when gambling revenue consisted solely of what was won from in-person gamblers.\"To compare these returns, it is important to consider how much the market has changed in the past 16 years,\" she said. \"To achieve the returns we have today took a substantial expansion and diversification of the New Jersey gaming product to compete with increased competition from neighboring states.\"That included the legalization of internet gambling in 2013, and the introduction of sports betting in 2018 following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case brought by New Jersey that cleared the way for any state to offer legal sports betting; about two-thirds of the states now do.\"In 2022, the Atlantic City casino industry continued to face challenges, including the lingering effects from the pandemic, a difficult economy and high inflation,\" said Mark Giannantonio, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey. \"As we move into a new year, Atlantic City casinos are committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers, which includes making significant investments that will continue to solidify Atlantic City's position as a world-class resort destination with top-notch dining, shopping and entertainment offerings.\"In-person winnings from gamblers finally surpassed pre-pandemic levels of 2019 -- a long-sought goal of the Atlantic City casino industry. The casinos won 2.78 billion from in-person gamblers in 2022, compared with 2.68 billion in 2019.But only three of the nine casinos -- Borgata, Ocean and Resorts -- had more in-person revenue in 2022 than they did in 2019.Six casinos had more total gambling revenue in 2022 than they did the year before.The market-leading Borgata won 1.3 billion in overall gambling revenue, up 18.2. The Golden Nugget won 581 million, up 10.2; Hard Rock won 576 million, up 12.7; Ocean won 389 million, up 13.6; Tropicana won 365 million, up 2.9, and Bally's won 198 million, up 37.3.Harrah's won 258 million, down 3.4; Caesars won 239 million, down 1, and Resorts won 168 million, down 0.3.Resorts Digital, the casino's online arm, won 546 million, up 21.3. Caesars Interactive NJ won 113 million, up 1.In terms of in-person gambling revenue, the Borgata won 724 million, up 19.5. Hard Rock won 492 million, up 14.2; Ocean won 356 million, up 16.3; Harrah's won 257 million, down 3.2; Tropicana won 248 million, down 1.8; Caesars won 235 million, down 0.7; Resorts won 167 million, up 0.8; Bally's won 153 million, up 9.4; and Golden Nugget won 148 million, up 1.1.The casinos, sports books and internet gambling operations paid more than 526 million in taxes in 2022, nearly half of that coming from a 15 tax on online gambling revenue.New Jersey's casinos and horse tracks took nearly 11 billion worth of sports bets in 2022, just a tiny bit more than they did in 2021.Of that 11 billion, the casinos, tracks and their online partners kept 726 million as revenue after paying off winning bets and other expenses.The 2022 figures got a nice boost from a strong December, in which total gambling revenue was 454 million, up 12.5 from December 2021. In-person casino winnings were 215 million in December, up 1.8 from a year earlier.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/WayneParryAC.", "normalized_body": "atlant citi nj ap new jersey gambl revenu match altim high bilion half amount casino inperson gamblersfigur releas tuesday new jersey divis game enforc show casino hors track take sport bet onlin partner type gambl bilion last year year earlier match level last sen advent casino gambl neighbor pensylvania sent new jersey gambl industri downward spiral eventuali led closur five casino oper timebut number reach hefti asist internet gambl sport bete revenu stream help contribut botom line also heavili share third parti sport bok tech platformssarah gradi asist director lloyd levenson institut stockton univers studi atlant citi gambl industri said tok enorm amount work casino state govern replic level gambl revenu consist sole inperson gambler compar return import consid much market chang past year said achiev return today tok substanti expans diversif new jersey game product compet increas competit neighbor state includ legal internet gambl introduct sport bete folow u suprem court rule case brought new jersey clear way state ofer legal sport bete twothird state atlant citi casino industri continu face chaleng includ linger efect pandem dificult economi high inflat said mark gianantonio presid casino asoci new jersey move new year atlant citi casino comit provid best posibl experi custom includ make signific invest wil continu solidifi atlant citi posit worldcla resort destin topnotch dine shope entertain ofer inperson wine gambler finali surpas prepandem level longsought goal atlant citi casino industri casino bilion inperson gambler compar bilion 0but thre nine casino borgata ocean resort inperson revenu 0six casino total gambl revenu year beforeth marketlead borgata bilion over gambl revenu golden nuget milion hard rock milion ocean milion tropicana milion bali milion 0harah milion caesar milion resort milion 0resort digit casino onlin arm milion caesar interact nj milion 0in term inperson gambl revenu borgata milion hard rock milion ocean milion harah milion tropicana milion caesar milion resort milion bali milion golden nuget milion 0the casino sport bok internet gambl oper paid milion tax nearli half come tax onlin gambl revenuenew jersey casino hors track tok nearli bilion worth sport bet tini bit 0of bilion casino track onlin partner kept milion revenu pay wine bet expensesth figur got nice bost strong decemb total gambl revenu milion decemb inperson casino wine milion decemb year earlierfolow wayn pari twiter"}

This one is a good post for beginners.Baking is an amalgamation of art and science where accurate measurements of the ingredients play an equal role in creativity and decoration. Remember that baking a cake is fun, rewarding, and satisfying. However, not all can master the art of baking a cake. Even the slightest change in ingredients or measurements can ruin the cake. A lot goes into a perfectly moist and soft cake. A lot of failed attempts will lead to a perfect cake. And that is why baking needs lots of patience, especially with the preparation. So, here are a few quick things that every baker should know.The first tip is to keep the ingredients at room temperature, whether the eggs, flour or sugar. All the refrigerated ingredients must be kept out an hour before using them. The second tip is to take time to cream butter and sugar for a light and fluffy texture. The next tip is to keep the ingredients dry and fresh, especially flour and raising agents. Beginners should always follow the recipe thoroughly and be precise with measurements. The other important thing is that wet ingredients always come before dry ingredients. These and many more crucial tips are now available at the below link.SweetHaus.com, the home of sweet treats, is back with some more seasonal treats.

In addition to the company's existing six-hour online course for those in Texas ages 18 to 24, the new course offerings are for parent-taught as well as instructor-led driver education. Students will have a video-only course with no reading required, and the course is available for all internet-connected devices such as laptops, smart phones, tablets and more.Chad Henry, owner of Drivers Education of America, said, \"Automobile collisions have been the number one killer of teens for decades. Texas state law requires that anyone who wants to get a license under the age of 18 must complete a driver education program. Drivers Education of America took the view that to train anyone how to master any physical activity like driving a vehicle that video demonstrations were the most effective teaching tool. So, Drivers Education of America is the only all video state of Texas approved driver education course. DEA further recognized that people retain more and learn faster when they are having fun, so the information is taught with a fun jovial conversational approach like on a podcast. The most effective way to learn an action is to watch it not read about it.\"According to the company's website, parents will help their teenagers with a 7-step process to obtain a Texas driver's license at a DPS testing location. Purchasing either the instructor-led or parent-taught online course from the company is the first step. The remaining steps include determining a parent's eligibility status to teach driving lessons or choosing a State-approved driving school, completing the first module of the online course, making an appointment with DPS to get a learner's license, completing the remainder of the online course modules and driving lessons, taking the free 2-hour Impact Texas Teen Driving course (ITTD) on the DPS website, and finally passing the in-car driving test at a DPS exam location.Parties interested in learning more about the online driving education course may visit the website ( https://www.driverseducationofamerica.com/texas/teen/ ) or calling (855) 675-8700.

Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Harris said in a hearing that after reviewing reports from both prosecutors and Jeremy's defense that he is in \"incurable neurocognitive decline\" from which he is unlikely to recover.Prosecutors asked that he be periodically reevaluated.A hearing on placing the 69-year-old Jeremy, whose legal name is Ronald Hyatt, in a state hospital will be held next month. Jeremy pleaded not guilty after a grand jury indicted him on 34 counts of sexual assault, including 12 counts of rape. \"When he was arrested two years ago I said he would be found innocent of all charges,\" Jeremy's attorney Stuart Goldfarb said in an email. \"Two years have passed and with the additional discovery I received I believed he would have have been found innocent. It is unfortunate due to mental condition he will not go to trial and have the the opportunity to clear his name.\"Jeremy, who has remained in jail since his arrest in 2020, did not attend the hearing. An email seeking comment Tuesday from the District Attorney's Office was not immediately returned. Nicknamed \"The Hedgehog,\" Jeremy has been among the best known and most prolific actors in the porn industry for decades, and became a recognizable pop cultural novelty through reality shows, public appearances and music videos. He has long been a magnet for seekers of autographs and selfies, which is how he first encountered most of the women and girls aged 15 to 51 he is accused of assaulting between the 1990s and 2019.According to transcripts of grand jury testimony from the women and girls obtained by The Associated Press, Jeremy would lure them into a small secluded space, often the bathroom of a West Hollywood bar and grill he frequents, trap them and sexually assault them. The Los Angeles Times first reported that Jeremy would not be going to trial. The charges stemmed from a district attorney's task force set up to investigate entertainment industry sexual misconduct after reports about Harvey Weinstein in 2017 made the metoo movement an international phenomenon. Jeremy was among a very few men charged in the task force's work, along with Weinstein himself, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault in December. Prosecutors are still deciding whether to retry Weinstein on several counts for which his jury was deadlocked. They plan to retry actor Danny Masterson on three rape counts after his jury failed to reach verdicts last month. ___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton", "normalized_body": "lo angel ap lo angel judg tuesday declar porn perform ron jeremi mentali incompet stand trial dozen rape sexual asault count superior court judg ronald hari said hear review report prosecutor jeremi defens incur neurocognit declin unlik recoverprosecutor ask periodicali revaluateda hear place 0yearold jeremi whose legal name ronald hyat state hospit wil held next month jeremi plead guilti grand juri indict count sexual asault includ count rape arest two year ago said would found inoc al charg jeremi atorney stuart goldfarb said email two year pase adit discoveri receiv believ would ben found inoc unfortun due mental condit wil go trial oportun clear name jeremi remain jail sinc arest atend hear email seke coment tuesday district atorney ofic imedi return nicknam hedgehog jeremi ben among best known prolif actor porn industri decad becam recogniz pop cultur novelti realiti show public apear music video long ben magnet seker autograph selfi first encount woman girl age acus asault betwen 0 0acord transcript grand juri testimoni woman girl obtain asoci pre jeremi would lure smal seclud space often bathrom west holywod bar gril frequent trap sexuali asault lo angel time first report jeremi would go trial charg steme district atorney task forc set investig entertain industri sexual misconduct report harvey weinstein made meto movement intern phenomenon jeremi among men charg task forc work along weinstein convict rape sexual asault decemb prosecutor stil decid whether retri weinstein sever count juri deadlock plan retri actor dani masterson thre rape count juri fail reach verdict last month folow ap entertain writer andrew dalton twiter"}

(AP) -- Video footage of Tyre Nichols ' arrest will be released to the public after an internal investigation into the actions of Memphis Police Department officers is completed and his family can review it, the city's mayor and police chief said Tuesday as friends and relatives held a memorial service for Nichols. His arrest and death have led to separate investigations by the police department and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Nichols' family, and protesters who rallied in recent days at a police station and the National Civil Rights Museum, have pushed for the release of police body camera footage and have called for officers to face charges stemming from the Jan. 7 arrest. Memphis Police Director Cerelyn \"CJ\" Davis and Mayor Jim Strickland said they anticipate that the police department's internal investigation will be completed by the end of this week. The leaders said they are arranging a meeting early next week with the family of Nichols, 29.\"We understand and agree that transparency around the events surrounding the death of Mr. Tyre Nichols is critically important, especially the release of the video footage,\" they said in a joint statement. Relatives have accused police of beating him and causing him to have a heart attack. Authorities have said Nichols, who was Black, experienced a medical emergency.Nichols was arrested after officers stopped him for reckless driving, police said. There was a confrontation as officers approached the driver, and he ran before he was confronted again by the pursuing officers, who arrested him, authorities said. He complained of shortness of breath and was hospitalized. Officials said a cause of death has not yet been determined.Davis said Sunday that the department was serving notice to the officers involved concerning policy violations.\"After reviewing various sources of information involving this incident, I have found that it is necessary to take immediate and appropriation action,\" Davis said in a statement.The statement did not indicate how many officers were involved.The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the state's police agency, said Nichols died Jan. 10. The agency is conducting a use-of-force investigation at the request of Shelby County District Attorney General Steve Mulroy.Relatives told news outlets that the officers who pulled over Nichols were in an unmarked vehicle and that he experienced cardiac arrest and kidney failure because of a beating by officers. Memphis police referred questions to the bureau, which said it was still investigating.As the probes continued, a portrait of Nichols' life and personality was presented at a memorial service Tuesday. Family and friends remembered Nichols as a joyful, lovable man who worked making boxes at FedEx, enjoyed skateboarding and regularly drank coffee and chatted with friends at Starbucks. Some of those in attendance wore T-shirts that read \"Justice for Tyre,\" and \"Skate in Peace.\"The service featured a mix of tears and laughter, as friends and family told stories about Nichols.

(Nasdaq:MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced positive topline data from its ConquerRSV Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial of mRNA-1345, an investigational mRNA vaccine targeting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults. Following review by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the primary efficacy endpoints have been met, including vaccine efficacy (VE) of 83.7 (95.88 CI: 66.1, 92.2; p0.0001) against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) as defined by two or more symptoms. Based on these results, Moderna intends to submit for regulatory approval in the first half of 2023.\"Today's results represent an important step forward in preventing lower respiratory disease due to RSV in adults 60 years of age and older. These data are encouraging, and represent the second demonstration of positive phase 3 trial results from our mRNA infectious disease vaccine platform after, Spikevax, our COVID-19 vaccine. We look forward to publishing the full data set and sharing the results at an upcoming infectious disease medical conference,\" said Stephane Bancel, Moderna's Chief Executive Officer. \"Respiratory diseases are a major public health priority given they have a significant health impact and are a leading cause of hospitalization. For these reasons, in addition to our mRNA-1345 RSV vaccine candidate, we are committed to developing a portfolio of respiratory mRNA vaccines to target the most significant viruses causing respiratory disease, including COVID-19, influenza, and human metapneumovirus.\"\"RSV significantly affects the health of older and high-risk adults, particularly those with comorbidities,\" said Abdullah Baqui, a principal investigator for the study sites in Bangladesh and Professor, Department of International Health, Director, International Center for Maternal and Newborn Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University. \"This trial will help to understand the role of severe acute respiratory infections in older adult populations and inform the future implementation of vaccines in adults in lower-resource areas.\"The ConquerRSV trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of approximately 37,000 adults 60 years or older in 22 countries, including the US ( NCT05127434 ). The primary efficacy endpoints were based on two definitions of RSV-LRTD defined as either two or more symptoms, or three or more symptoms of disease. The interim analysis was based on 64 cases of RSV-LRTD with two or more symptoms, of which 55 occurred in the placebo group and 9 occurred in the mRNA-1345 group, and 20 cases of RSV-LRTD with three or more symptoms, of which 17 cases were observed in the placebo group compared with three cases observed in the mRNA-1345 group. The other primary efficacy endpoint against RSV-LRTD defined by three or more symptoms was also met, with a VE of 82.4 (96.36 CI: 34.8, 95.3; p0.0078). The trial is ongoing, and additional efficacy analyses are planned as cases accrue, including for severe RSV.A concurrent review of available safety data was also conducted by the DSMB. mRNA-1345 was well tolerated with no safety concerns identified. Safety and tolerability will continue to be followed in this ongoing study. To date most solicited adverse reactions were mild or moderate and the most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in the mRNA-1345 group were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. The overall rate of severe (Grade 3 or greater) solicited systemic adverse reactions was 4.0 for mRNA-1345 and 2.8 for placebo. The overall rate of Grade 3 or greater solicited local adverse reactions was 3.2 for mRNA-1345 and 1.7 for placebo. The study is ongoing, and an updated analysis of safety and tolerability will be provided at the time of regulatory submission.Moderna will submit the data for peer-reviewed publication and present it at an upcoming scientific meeting.About RSVRSV, a highly contagious seasonal respiratory virus and a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia, causes a particularly large burden of disease in infants and older adults. RSV can cause severe disease with an estimated 5.2 million cases and nearly half a million hospitalizations in adults 60 years or older reported across high-income countries in 2019. Each year in the US, approximately 60,000-120,000 older adults are hospitalized, and 6,000-10,000 of them die due to RSV infection.Complications in adults include respiratory distress, pneumonia, bronchitis, hospitalization, and death. In addition to acute infection, RSV can exacerbate underlying medical conditions such as asthma and COPD and can result in acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and long-term decline of respiratory functions.About mRNA-1345mRNA-1345 is an investigational RSV vaccine that consists of a single mRNA sequence encoding for a stabilized prefusion F glycoprotein. The vaccine uses the same lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as in the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The F glycoprotein is on the surface of the virus and is required for infection by helping the virus to enter host cells. It exists in two states, prefusion and postfusion. The prefusion conformation is a significant target of potent neutralizing antibodies and is highly conserved across both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes.Moderna's RSV Clinical TrialsThe Phase 3 trial is part of a comprehensive clinical development program investigating the immunogenicity and safety of mRNA-1345. Moderna is advancing a broad respiratory portfolio, and the Phase 3 ConquerRSV trial is one of five ongoing RSV trials, including pediatric and combination clinical trials.Since RSV causes a significant disease burden in children, mRNA-1345 is being tested in an ongoing Phase 1 trial in pediatric populations; the clinical trial is fully enrolled.Moderna has developed a respiratory combination vaccine program to target the most significant viruses causing respiratory disease in older adults, including combinations against RSV, COVID-19, influenza, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Moderna recently started a Phase 1 study of mRNA-1230 targeting SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, and mRNA-1045 targeting influenza and RSV. In an ongoing Phase 3 trial, Moderna is evaluating the coadministration of mRNA-1345 and a licensed influenza vaccine, and coadministration of mRNA-1345 with mRNA-1273.214.Moderna plans to initiate a Phase 1 pediatric trial of mRNA-1365, targeting RSV and hMPV. Like RSV, hMPV is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in the pediatric population and a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and older adults.About ModernaIn over 10 years since its inception, Moderna has transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA), to an enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mRNA and lipid nanoparticle formulation, and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale. Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators, which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing. Most recently, Moderna's capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use and approval of one of the earliest and most effective vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic.Moderna's mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases and auto-immune diseases. Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past eight years.

Mark Knittle, 63, of Captain Cook, was fishing with a friend off Honaunau on the Big Island on Sunday, when he hooked an ahi, or tuna, police said. \"The friend heard Knittle say, 'The fish is huge,' then saw Knittle go overboard into the water,\" according to a police news release. The friend tried to grab the line, but Knittle disappeared within seconds, the release said. The friend jumped in but couldn't see Knittle. The search was expected to continue through Tuesday, U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson Petty Officer Ryan Fisher said. The Hawaii County Fire Department was helping the Coast Guard search from the sea and air. \"Usually our incidents like this are along the coastlines. This is a different situation because it's out in the deep,\" said Darwin Okinaka, Hawaii County Fire Department assistant chief of operations. According to police, Knittle and his friend were 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from the Honaunau Boat Ramp. \"If there's a fish that's actually pulling him around, you don't know where he could go,\" Okinaka said. Ahi can weigh several hundred pounds.

Tsikhanouskaya, who left the ex-Soviet nation shortly after the vote under pressure from authorities, is on trial in absentia along with four other leading opposition figures. She is facing charges of high treason, conspiracy to seize power and undermining national security, and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.Tsikhanouskaya said she learned from media reports about the closed-door trial, adding that she was unable to reach her lawyer appointed by the Belarusian authorities.\"It looks like farce,\" Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, where she is attending a global economic forum. \"I will be sentenced to years and years. The judge will give me so many years, as he is ordered to do.\"In Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced the trial as politically motivated and said it relied on \"baseless charges.\"He said in a statement that the State Department slapped U.S. visa restrictions on 25 individuals \"for their involvement in undermining democracy.\" Those targeted include members of the National Assembly of Belarus who approved legislation authorizing the death penalty for people convicted of \"attempted acts of terrorism,\" a charge Blinken said is used to repress and intimidate the democratic opposition and civil society. \"We will not stand by as this regime continues to harass and repress peaceful protesters, the democratic opposition, journalists, unionists, activists, human rights defenders and everyday Belarusians,\" the statement said.In December 2021, Tsikhanouskaya's husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of organizing mass unrest and inciting hatred, allegations which he rejected. On Monday, the authorities leveled new accusations against him.\"The lawyer visits him once a week just to check if he's at least alive, because the conditions in prisons are awful,\" Tsikhanouskaya told the AP. \"He was put very often in punishment cells and when you are in prison, you do not have rights at all.\"Her husband, a popular video blogger and activist, planned to challenge Lukashenko in the August 2020 vote, but was arrested in May 2020, two days after he declared his candidacy. Tsikhanouskaya, a former English teacher, ran in his place.Tsikhanouskaya and other opposition activists rejected the official results that handed Lukashenko a sixth term in office as fraudulent. The vote triggered a months-long wave of unprecedented mass protests, the largest of which saw about 200,000 people taking to the streets of the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Lukashenko's government responded with a violent crackdown on demonstrations, arresting more than 35,000 and brutally beating thousands. The authorities have continued their repression, and 1,438 people in Belarus are in prisons on politically motivated charges, according to human rights groups.Tsikhanouskaya urged the West to state a clear strategy on Belarus and support the country's opposition.She emphasized that backing the opposition is particularly important because Russia used Belarus' territory to invade Ukraine last Feb. 24 and stations its troops and weapons on Belarusian territory. Tsikhanouskaya noted that opposition activists in Belarus help gather information about Russian troop movements, adding that \"we deliver this information to Ukraine.\"\"I don't want the world to overlook Belarus, to explain once again why Belarus is important, that without a safe, free, democratic Belarus, there will not be stable peace in the region,\" Tsikhanouskaya said.___Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from Tallinn, Estonia.", "normalized_body": "davo switzerland ap trial absentia open tuesday belaru top oposit leader denounc proced farc urg west bolster suport countri beleagu opositionsviatlana tsikhanouskaya main chaleng august presidenti elect extend presid alexand lukashenko rule reject belarusian oposit west sham tsikhanouskaya left exsoviet nation shortli vote presur author trial absentia along four lead oposit figur face charg high treason conspiraci seiz power undermin nation secur could face year prison convictedtsikhanouskaya said learn medium report closedor trial ade unabl reach lawyer apoint belarusian author lok like farc tsikhanouskaya told asoci pre interview davo switzerland atend global econom forum wil sentenc year year judg wil give mani year order washington secretari state antoni blinken denounc trial politicali motiv said reli basel charg said statement state depart slape u visa restrict individu involv undermin democraci target includ member nation asembl belaru aprov legisl author death penalti peopl convict atempt act teror charg blinken said use repr intimid democrat oposit civil societi wil stand regim continu hara repr peac protest democrat oposit journalist unionist activist human right defend everyday belarusian statement saidin decemb tsikhanouskaya husband siarhei tsikhanouski convict sentenc year prison charg organ ma unrest incit hatr aleg reject monday author level new acus lawyer visit wek check he least aliv condit prison aw tsikhanouskaya told ap put often punish cel prison right al husband popular video bloger activist plane chaleng lukashenko august vote arest may two day declar candidaci tsikhanouskaya former english teacher ran placetsikhanouskaya oposit activist reject ofici result hand lukashenko sixth term ofic fraudul vote triger monthslong wave unpreced ma protest largest saw peopl take stret belarusian capit minsk lukashenko govern respond violent crackdown demonstr arest brutali beat thousand author continu repres peopl belaru prison politicali motiv charg acord human right groupstsikhanouskaya urg west state clear strategi belaru suport countri opositionsh emphas back oposit particularli import rusia use belaru teritori invad ukrain last feb station trop weapon belarusian teritori tsikhanouskaya note oposit activist belaru help gather inform rusian trop movement ade deliv inform ukrain dont want world overlok belaru explain belaru import without safe fre democrat belaru wil stabl peac region tsikhanouskaya saidyura karmanau contribut report talin estonia"}

It's a complex story, but made unique in the context of genius.\"-- William Kinsolving, author/playwrightSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, USA, January 17, 2023/ EINPresswire.com / -- A unique musical, \"That Week with The Bachs\" by author/playwright William Kinsolving, will be presented to the public for the first time at the Grace Cathedral's \"Spacious Grace Festival\" in San Francisco, February 16-18. Showtime every evening is 7:30 to 9pm with an additional show on Saturday, Feb 18, from 2 to 3:30pm.The playwright has assembled an extraordinary cast, including nationally and internationally known opera stars Frederica von Stade, Philip Skinner and Marnie Breckenridge.The musical is being presented by the Ghiberti Center at the Cathedral in collaboration with the Merola Opera Program. Rather than being a full production, Kinsolving describes it as a concert version of the musical, \"an iPad-in-hand staged presentation.\" More information and how to buy tickets can be found on the production's website HERE.The story takes place over seven days in seven scenes during which seven members of the Bach family collaborate to create the seven movements of the great Cantata 140.\"The musical portrays a pivotal moment in the lives of the star-crossed Bach family,\" explains Kinsolving. \"Bach had composed hundreds of cantatas in the 1720s -- cycles of them -- then went on to create other glorious things. Abruptly, in November 1731, he urgently stopped everything and rushed to compose a new cantata. Why? Solving that simple mystery lead me to worlds of revelations about the family. I quickly realized that the only way to tell the story of that amazing week was with a musical.\"He goes on to say: \"History has made a god of Bach with all the resulting remoteness of worship, burdening even his talented kids -- those who gained any degree of fame - with some of this awed glory. My intent in the musical is to bring to light Bach's humanity, his convoluted family, and his profound and invaluable second marriage. It's a complex story - sad, joyous, and thrilling -- but made unique in the context of genius.\"All music is by Johann Sebastian Bach. Book and lyrics by Kinsolving. Musical director is Daniel Lockert. Vocal arrangements by Bradley Greenwald.Standouts among the noteworthy cast are:Frederica von Stade (The Narrator) - von Stade is one of the greatest American opera singers of her generation. Since her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1970, she has performed in operas, musicals, concerts and recitals in venues throughout the world, including La Scala, the Paris Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburger Festspielhaus, Covent Garden, Glyndebourne and Carnegie Hall. She has also been a prolific and eclectic recording artist, earning nine Grammy nominations for best classical vocalist, and she has made many appearances on television.Philip Skinner (Johann Sebastian Bach) - Skinner has a long association with San Francisco Opera, with more than 380 performances in 55 productions. He's sung Verdi at Carnegie Hall and Beethoven at the Hollywood Bowl, as well as performing major roles all over Europe.Marnie Breckenridge (Anna Magdalena Bach) - Breckenridge has won acclaim internationally for a repertoire running from the Baroque to the Modern. From Jake Heggie's \"To Hell and Back co-staring with Patti LuPone, to being chosen by Loren Maazel for his many performances of \"The Rape of Lucrecia,\" she has appeared in major roles at most great opera houses south of the Arctic Circle.Kinsolving? \"Well, I'm the word guy. I sang Bach from the time I was six in too many choirs. When I was in drama school in London, I wangled my way into a performance of St. Matthew Passion at the Royal Festival Hall.\" He subsequently performed in many musicals and many nightclubs (as a \"saloon singer\"). As a writer, he's published five novels (one a New York Times bestseller), and wrote, adapted, and/or doctored 54 screenplays for every major studio in Hollywood.

Pillen reveals plan for education funding", "article_date": "January 17, 2023 GMT", "article_author": "By MARGERY A. BECK", "article_link": "https://apnews.com/article/nebraska-schools-education-funding-17e8dfce2fc2580f13c9eb5f27baac69", "article_body": "LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska's newly minted Gov. Jim Pillen proposed Tuesday to vastly increase K-12 public education funding using money from the state's huge cash reserve. It's a plan that even those typically critical of Republican education reform efforts say holds promise.The plan, spread over measures to be introduced by at least three lawmakers, proposes to increase education funding by 2.5 billion through 2030 while still cutting property taxes. Pillen said the money would be in addition to current state aid funding to schools. Currently, Nebraska's public schools are funded largely through local property taxes. The state provides equalization funding to schools to cover funding gaps in those districts with low tax revenues, high enrollment and/or large numbers of disadvantaged students.Pillen held a news conference Tuesday with Republican lawmakers to unveil a plan that would provide 1,500 for each student, primarily those in the 180 school districts that either don't receive state equalization funding or receive less than 1,500 per student. Districts that receive more than 1,500 per student in state aid would not see that funding reduced.\"No district will receive less aid than what they have today,\" Pillen said.The plan would put up 1 billion in the first year, then 250 million each of the following six years, said Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who plans to introduce the funding portion of the package. Another portion of the package would lower property taxes by limiting year-over-year tax-collection increases. It would enact a cap of a 3 increase in revenue per year.\"This provides dollar-for-dollar property tax relief,\" Clements said.Sen. Tom Briese of Albion, who introduced the revenue cap Tuesday, said the cap has built-in flexibility for those districts that have a need to raise more revenue in a year than the cap allows. They can do that with a supermajority vote of the school board or voters, he said. The cap does not apply to proposed school bond issues, which are adopted or rejected at the ballot box.The package would also provide millions in additional funding to teach special education students.\"Nebraska is nearly last in the country in education funding by the state,\" Briese said. \"This package can chip away at that dynamic.\"Briese said proponents expect to be able to maintain the increased funding beyond 2030, but he did not detail how.Nebraska ended the fiscal year in mid-2022 with a nearly 1 billion cash reserve, and fiscal forecasters predict a balance of 2.3 billion by this summer. Much of that additional revenue was garnered through federal pandemic recovery funding and boosts from rising inflation.Pillen campaigned, in part, on changing Nebraska's school-funding formula to a per-student basis, often repeating his mantra of \"leave no child behind.\"Critics had thumped a plan that would have dumped equalization funding in favor of educational savings accounts -- which have been proposed in at least a dozen other states this year -- saying it could cost Nebraska's largest districts up to 270 million.But the plan announced Tuesday by Pillen was received with cautious optimism by those who usually find themselves squaring off against Republican-led education funding proposals.Tim Royers, president of the Millard Education Association, spoke Tuesday for the Nebraska State Education Association, the union representing about 28,000 of the state's public school teachers.\"We think there's a lot of promise in this,\" Royers said. \"For a long time, there's been a lack of state-level investment in our kids, and now we have a 2.5 billion proposal to do just that. That's exactly what we wanted to hear.\"OpenSky Policy Institute, a Nebraska tax policy think tank that has long been critical of tax-cutting proposals, said it wants to study the plan to better gauge its long-term sustainability and affect on schools. But OpenSky executive director Rebecca Firestone offered rare praise for the effort.\"We have long noted that the best way to address property taxes in Nebraska is to increase the share of state support for public K-12 education,\" she said.", "normalized_body": "lincoln neb ap nebraska newli mint gov jim pilen propos tuesday vastli increas k0 public educ fund use money state huge cash reserv plan even typicali critic republican educ reform efort say hold promiseth plan spread measur introduc least thre lawmak propos increas educ fund bilion stil cute properti tax pilen said money would adit curent state aid fund schol curent nebraska public schol fund larg local properti tax state provid equal fund schol cover fund gap district low tax revenu high enrol andor larg number disadvantag studentspilen held news confer tuesday republican lawmak unveil plan would provid student primarili schol district either dont receiv state equal fund receiv le per student district receiv per student state aid would se fund reduc district wil receiv le aid today pilen saidth plan would put bilion first year milion folow six year said sen rob clement elmwod plan introduc fund portion packag anoth portion packag would lower properti tax limit yearoveryear taxcolect increas would enact cap increas revenu per year provid dolarfordolar properti tax relief clement saidsen tom brie albion introduc revenu cap tuesday said cap builtin flexibl district ned rais revenu year cap alow supermajor vote schol board voter said cap apli propos schol bond isu adopt reject balot boxth packag would also provid milion adit fund teach special educ student nebraska nearli last countri educ fund state brie said packag chip away dynam brie said propon expect abl maintain increas fund beyond detail hownebraska end fiscal year mid0 nearli bilion cash reserv fiscal forecast predict balanc bilion sumer much adit revenu garner feder pandem recoveri fund bost rise inflationpilen campaign part chang nebraska scholfund formula perstud basi often repeat mantra leav child behind critic thump plan would dump equal fund favor educ save acount ben propos least dozen state year say could cost nebraska largest district milionbut plan anounc tuesday pilen receiv cautiou optim usuali find squar republicanl educ fund proposalstim royer presid milard educ asoci spoke tuesday nebraska state educ asoci union repres state public schol teacher think there lot promis royer said long time there ben lack statelevel invest kid bilion propos that exactli want hear openski polici institut nebraska tax polici think tank long ben critic taxcut propos said want studi plan beter gaug longterm sustain afect schol openski execut director rebeca fireston ofer rare prais efort long note best way adr properti tax nebraska increas share state suport public k0 educ said"}

The officers spotted two males and pulled over to speak with them, Chief of Detectives James Essig said.\"As they pull up at least one male fires at least six times, striking the windshield and our officer,\" Essig said.The wounded officer and his partner returned fire and gave chase on foot, Essig said. A 16-year-old male was arrested and a .32-caliber gun was recovered from him, the chief said.Seconds after the initial shooting, Essig said, more shots were fired, not at the officers but toward the location from which the first shots had been fired. Police were seeking the person who was with the 16-year old and the person who fired the second volley of shots.Sewell said her department \"will stop at nothing to make sure that these subjects involved in this shooting and the people who drive violence in this city will be brought to justice.\"Mayor Eric Adams, who joined police officials at a news conference at the hospital where the wounded officer was recovering, said he had spoken with the officer and his family.\"He is proud to have done his job on the front line to deal with the violence we have witnessed, particularly in the borough of the Bronx,\" Adams said. The mayor, a former police officer, added, \"Too many young people have too many guns in their hands. And our job is to create a pathway to stop that and to ensure that we remove these guns off our streets.\" Patrick Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association, praised the officers' professionalism under fire.\"The police officer that was struck and shot still pursued the perpetrator,\" Lynch said. \"His partner pursued the perpetrator, recognizing his partner was shot, throws him in the car.

(\"C-S\"), has entered into a joint venture agreement with Western Michigan-based NuWay Go Recycle Center LLC (\"NWG\") to establish Clean-Seas Newaygo (\"CSN\").The announcement follows Michigan's December 23rd recognition of pyrolysis as an approved manufacturing process, creating a clear permitting pathway for the project.Headquartered in Newaygo County, NWG is a new venture of American Classic, a fixture in Western Michigan construction, building supply, and commercial and residential waste management since 2001. American Classic's 2022 acquisition of Cart Right recycling deepened their united commitment to responsible, innovative waste handling throughout Michigan, and ensures a consistent supply of plastic feedstock to the CSN facility.In separate votes last month, the Newaygo City Council and the Newaygo City Planning Commission both approved plans to develop the facility, which will divert post-industrial and post-consumer waste plastic from landfill and incineration, and convert it through pyrolysis into precursors for new plastics, ultra-low sulfur fuels and oils, and Clean-Seas' branded hydrogen, AquaH(tm).Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, CSN will co-locate at American Classic's recently acquired 313 W. State Road facility in the City of Newaygo. American Classic has committed to supplying the necessary feedstock for CSN operations. The parties will work collectively to secure additional permits and approvals. Clean-Seas will use its relationships and expertise to secure capital and technology to establish the facility, which is expected to begin operations in late 2023 or early 2024.In its Phase I, CSN projects processing 50 tons per day (tpd) with the expectation to expand the facility in subsequent phases, eventually diverting up to 500 tpd of waste plastic from landfill.Pictured below: American Classic's 45,000 sq. ft. facility, with rail spur\"This is an exciting opportunity for Clean-Seas to partner with American Classic and the Thompson family who have built a formidable presence in Michigan and intimately understand the recycling industry and local regulatory environment,\" said Chris Galazzi, vice president of business development for Clean-Seas. \"This partnership, combining local expertise with Clean-Seas resources is a model for our work throughout the United States.\"Phase I of the project is currently budgeted at 20 million with currently anticipated funding from debt and equity. Once established, operations are expected to begin in American Classic's 45,000 sq. ft. facility which sits adjacent to a rail line for easy off-loading of waste plastic and pickup of CSN converted commodity products. In addition to anticipated debt and equity funding for the project, additional sources of funding may include Michigan State incentives and grants which are available through the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\"The plastic pollution problem is a global issue but we wanted to do something about it in our own backyard,\" said Leon Thompson, founder of American Classic. \"Meeting the guys at Clean-Seas and understanding their vision for addressing the world's plastic problem with local solutions makes perfect sense. We are proud to be partners on this journey; it's good for our community, Western Michigan and will set a terrific example for our industry.\"Clean-Seas Newaygo joins previously announced Clean-Seas U.S. projects in Arizona (Arizona State University and the Walton Sustainability Solution Services), Massachusetts (MacVallee LLC), and Puerto Rico (Main Line Ventures LLC).About Clean Vision CorporationClean Vision Corporation operates and intends to acquire and operate a portfolio of synergistic companies in the sustainable clean technology and green energy sectors.

(AP) -- A group of South Dakota Republican lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday to outlaw gender-affirming health care for transgender youth, pushing the state to join at least a dozen others considering anti-transgender legislation this year.The South Dakota bill, unveiled at a state Capitol news conference, aims to keep children younger than 18 from accessing puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy or surgeries that enable them to present as a gender different from the sex on their birth certificate. It would also punish doctors who provide the care by revoking their medical license and exposing them to civil litigation.South Dakota Republicans have perennially considered bills aimed at limiting the health care, school facilities and sports teams that transgender youth can access. A law banning trans girls and college-age women from participating in sports that match their gender went into effect after the Legislature passed it last year. Though other proposals aimed at trans youth have found mixed success in the Republican-controlled Statehouse, critics said that even bringing the proposals sends a harmful message to trans children.\"Gender-affirming care is a critical part for helping transgender adolescents succeed in school, establish healthy relationships with their friends and family and really, truly live authentically to who they are,\" Democratic Rep. Erin Healy said.But Republican Rep. Jon Hansen, one of the lawmakers pushing the bill, argued that puberty was a \"natural cure\" for gender dysphoria, which is the distress felt when someone's gender expression does not match their gender identity.\"This is a mental health problem that needs to be addressed,\" said Republican Rep. Bethany Soye, who is the bill's primary sponsor.Samantha Chapman, the advocacy manager for the ACLU of South Dakota, said in a statement that the lawmakers proposing the bill were spreading \"lies and misinformation\" about trans people.The World Professional Association for Transgender Health said last year that teens experiencing gender dysphoria can start taking hormones at age 14 and can have certain surgeries at ages 15 or 17. The group acknowledged potential risks but said it was unethical to withhold early treatments, which can improve psychological well-being and reduce suicide risk.However, conservative state lawmakers across the country have targeted trans health care. Last year, Arkansas and Alabama passed similar bans. But both were blocked by federal courts.\"Every year, South Dakota lawmakers zero in on transgender youth,\" Chapman said. \"And every year the transgender community is hurt while meaningful problems go unaddressed.\"", "normalized_body": "pier sd ap group south dakota republican lawmak introduc bil tuesday outlaw genderafirm health care transgend youth push state join least dozen other consid antitransgend legisl yearth south dakota bil unveil state capitol news confer aim kep child younger ace pubertyblock drug hormon therapi surgeri enabl present gender difer sex birth certif would also punish doctor provid care revok medic licens expo civil litigationsouth dakota republican pereniali consid bil aim limit health care schol facil sport team transgend youth ace law bane tran girl colegeag woman particip sport match gender went efect legislatur pase last year though propos aim tran youth found mix suce republicancontrol statehous critic said even bring propos send harm mesag tran child genderafirm care critic part help transgend adolesc suce schol establish healthi relationship friend famili reali truli live authenticali democrat rep erin heali saidbut republican rep jon hansen one lawmak push bil argu puberti natur cure gender dysphoria distr felt someon gender expres match gender ident mental health problem ned adres said republican rep bethani soy bil primari sponsorsamantha chapman advocaci manag aclu south dakota said statement lawmak propos bil spread lie misinform tran peopleth world profesion asoci transgend health said last year ten experienc gender dysphoria start take hormon age certain surgeri age group acknowledg potenti risk said uneth withold earli treatment improv psycholog welb reduc suicid riskhowev conserv state lawmak acro countri target tran health care last year arkansa alabama pase similar ban block feder court everi year south dakota lawmak zero transgend youth chapman said everi year transgend comun hurt meaning problem go unadres"}

(AP) -- Two former North Carolina House members who have now returned as representatives after years away have landed committee leadership positions, Speaker Tim Moore announced on Tuesday while unveiling committee rosters for the new session.Rep. Stephen Ross, an Alamance County Republican, was named a House Commerce Committee chairman with GOP Rep. John Sauls of Lee County. Ross had served four House terms before losing to Democrat Ricky Hurtado in 2020. Ross defeated Hurtado in a repeat election matchup in November. Democratic Rep. Tricia Cotham of Mecklenburg County will be one of three chairs of the K-12 education committee, joining two Republicans. Cotham served in the House for nearly 10 years through 2016 before returning as a candidate last year. Cotham is one of a few Democrats who have received top committee positions in a chamber where Republicans now hold 71 of the 120 seats. They include Rep. Shelly Willingham of Edgecombe County, who is now one of three chairmen leading the alcoholic beverage control committee. Also, veteran Rep. Michael Wray of Northampton County was elevated to one of four senior chairmen of the powerful House Finance Committee. Democrats received chairmanships during the 2021-22 session. But Moore's decision to award gavels to members of the opposing party this year could help Republicans assert influence should they attempt to override potential vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Republicans are one seat short of holding a veto-proof majority in the chamber, so Democratic support for overrides is likely needed.House leadership also chose GOP Rep. Keith Kidwell of Beaufort County to join Wray as a new finance committee senior chairman, joining returning Reps. John Bradford of Mecklenburg County and Mitchell Setzer of Catawba County at the post. A previous senior chairman, GOP Rep. John Szoka, didn't seek reelection last fall. Kidwell and Wray were vice chairs during the previous session. The senior chairmen of the House Appropriations Committee remain GOP Reps. Dean Arp of Union County; Donny Lambeth of Forsyth County; and Jason Saine of Lincoln County. Wray and Sauls also remain chairs of the House Ethics Committee. Tuesday's list also shows that 18-term GOP Rep. Julia Howard of Davie County has regained some prominence in committees after a public feud with Moore over a tax relief bill led him to remove Howard as a senior chair of the finance committee in 2021. Howard will be on the second tier of the committee's leadership -- labeled a chair -- and she will be the top leader of a new unemployment insurance committee. The House also has created a new \"oversight reform\" committee. There are now three judiciary committees, down from four.The General Assembly met for one day last week to pick new chamber leaders like Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, who has already announced the Senate's committee assignments. The legislature reconvenes Jan. 25 to begin the two-year session in earnest.", "normalized_body": "raleigh nc ap two former north carolina hous member return repres year away land comit leadership posit speaker tim anounc tuesday unveil comit roster new sesionrep stephen ro alam counti republican name hous comerc comit chairman gop rep john saul le counti ro serv four hous term lose democrat ricki hurtado ro defeat hurtado repeat elect matchup novemb democrat rep tricia cotham mecklenburg counti wil one thre chair k0 educ comit join two republican cotham serv hous nearli year return candid last year cotham one democrat receiv top comit posit chamber republican hold seat includ rep sheli wilingham edgecomb counti one thre chairman lead alcohol beverag control comit also veteran rep michael wray northampton counti elev one four senior chairman power hous financ comit democrat receiv chairmanship sesion more decis award gavel member opos parti year could help republican asert influenc atempt overid potenti veto democrat gov roy coper republican one seat short hold vetoprof major chamber democrat suport overid like nededhous leadership also chose gop rep keith kidwel beaufort counti join wray new financ comit senior chairman join return rep john bradford mecklenburg counti mitchel setzer catawba counti post previou senior chairman gop rep john szoka didnt sek relect last fal kidwel wray vice chair previou sesion senior chairman hous apropri comit remain gop rep dean arp union counti doni lambeth forsyth counti jason sain lincoln counti wray saul also remain chair hous ethic comit tuesday list also show 0term gop rep julia howard davi counti regain promin comit public feud tax relief bil led remov howard senior chair financ comit howard wil second tier comit leadership label chair wil top leader new unemploy insur comit hous also creat new oversight reform comit thre judiciari comit fourth gener asembl met one day last wek pick new chamber leader like senat leader phil berger alreadi anounc senat comit asign legislatur reconven jan begin twoyear sesion earnest"}

The defendants have been charged with armed criminal association, violent attempt to subvert the democratic state of law, staging a coup and damage to public property, the prosecutor'general's office said in a written statement Monday night. Their identities have not yet been released.More than a thousand people were arrested on the day of the Jan. 8 riot, which bore strong similarities to the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Congress by mobs who wanted to overturn former President Donald Trump's loss in November's election. Rioters who stormed through the Brazilian Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court in the capital, Brasilia, sought to have the armed forces intervene and overturn Bolsonaro's loss to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The rioters \"attempted, with the use of violence and serious threat, to abolish the democratic rule of law, preventing or restricting the exercise of constitutional powers,\" according to an excerpt of charges included in a statement. \"The ultimate objective of the attack ... was the installation of an alternative government regime.\"The attackers were not charged with terrorism because under Brazilian law such a charge must involve xenophobia or prejudice based on race, ethnicity or religion. The prosecutor-general's office sent its charges to the Supreme Court after the Senate's president, Rodrigo Pacheco, last week provided a list of people accused of rampaging through Congress.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said the 40-year-old man, identified as Hamdi Shaker Abdullah Abu Dayyah, was shot and killed by Israeli forces in Halhul, north of the West Bank city of Hebron. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade -- an armed militia affiliated with Fatah, the secular political party that controls the Palestinian Authority -- claimed the man as a fighter and said he had also been an officer in the Palestinian security forces.The Israeli military said in a statement that troops in the area were fired upon and returned fire. It added that Israeli forces were investigating reports that the killed Palestinian was connected to an earlier shooting attack on an Israeli bus. Tensions have soared in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has been conducting near-nightly arrest raids since last spring, after a wave of Palestinian attacks against Israelis that killed 19 people. Another 10 Israelis were killed in a second string of attacks later last year. Israel says the raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks. The Palestinians see them as further entrenchment of Israel's open-ended, 55-year occupation of lands they seek for their future state. On Monday, Israeli security forces shot and killed a 14-year-old Palestinian during an early morning raid in the West Bank, Palestinian health officials said. The Israeli army said forces entered the Dheisha camp and were bombarded by Molotov cocktails and rocks. It said soldiers responded with live fire. Violence and unrest have raged for months in the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip -- territories the Palestinians want for their hoped-for state. Some half-million Israelis now live in about 130 settlements across the West Bank. The Palestinians and much of the international community view the settlements as an obstacle to peace.Settler attacks in the West Bank have escalated in recent months, with the U.N. reporting last fall that Israeli settlers and civilians perpetrated over a hundred attacks against Palestinians last year, resulting in damage to Palestinian property and dozens of Palestinian injuries.On Tuesday, the United States condemned an assault against a group of hikers, among them Palestinians and Americans, that happened last Friday at a nature reserve north of the West Bank city of Jericho. Footage widely shared online shows Israeli settlers, cloaked in hoodies and waving sticks, ambushing the hikers from behind on a dirt path. Women scream and cry as one of the settlers hits them with his club. \"I'll break your head!\" he shouts at them in Arabic. The Israeli police have not announced any arrests of the suspects.The U.S. Palestinian Affairs Office described the \"brazen assault\" as \"shocking.\"\"Those who incite violence and exacerbate tensions must stop,\" it said.Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B'Tselem, making it the deadliest year since 2004. Israel says most of the dead were militants. But Palestinian stone-throwers, youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations also have been killed.___Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

We are advancing both our Golden Mile and County Line properties forward towards a development decision for both production and shareholder dividend longevity. In addition, we will continue exploring our exciting portfolio of Nevada properties, all of which have surface or near surface high-grade gold. 2022 production marks another successful milestone year for Fortitude Gold.\"Full financial results for 2022 will be available at the time the Company files its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.About Fortitude Gold Corp.:Fortitude Gold is a U.S. based gold producer targeting projects with low operating costs, high margins, and strong returns on capital.

In 2015 at the height of the migration crisis, hundreds of thousands reached Greece, the vast majority making their way to Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast and then heading north through the Balkans to wealthier European countries.\"After the explosion in the period 2015-2019, in 2021 we had the lowest flows of the decade, 8,745, and steadily low in 2022 too\" Mitarachi said. \"The result is that instead of 92,000 asylum seekers living in 121 facilities, we have today 14,000 in 33 facilities.\"The U.N.'s refugee agency had slightly different figures, listing a total of 9,157 arrivals in Greece in 2021 - 4,331 by sea and 4,826 by land. For 2022, the UNCHR office's figures show a total of 18,778 new arrivals in Greece: 12,756 by sea and 6,022 by land.In 2015, Mitarachi said, arrivals in Greece accounted for 75 of the total number of irregular arrivals in the European Union, while in 2022 that figure stood at just 5. He added that Greece was also amending legislation to attract workers through legal migration for employment.\"The migration issue doesn't end. And it is at the same time a challenge and a need. Our country is implementing a strict but fair migration policy,\" he said. \"With an emphasis on migration with rules, criteria, agreements, in accordance with our needs. But we stand firmly against smuggling rings and illegal migration.\" Greece has been widely accused by migrants and rights groups of carrying out summary deportations of people as soon as they reach Greek soil without allowing them to apply for asylum -- an illegal practice known as pushbacks. Despite considerable indications of the practice both on islands and at Greece's land border with Turkey, Greek officials strenuously deny it occurs.___Follow AP's global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration", "normalized_body": "athen grece ap grece migrat minist say number migrant ariv grece drope dramaticali past two year number asylumsek live countri also falenspeak tuesday event mark third aniversari migrat asylum ministri foundat minist noti mitarachi credit centeright govern polici migrat drop includ increas border secur faster asylum procedur tighten migrat lawsgrec saw lowest number ariv decad mitarachi said pute figur peopl height migrat crisi hundr thousand reach grece vast major make way grek island nearbi turkish coast head north balkan wealthier european countri explos period lowest flow decad steadili low mitarachi said result instead asylum seker live facil today facil un refug agenc slightli difer figur list total ariv grece sea land unchr ofic figur show total new ariv grece sea landin mitarachi said ariv grece acount total number iregular ariv european union figur stod ade grece also amend legisl atract worker legal migrat employ migrat isu doesnt end time chaleng ned countri implement strict fair migrat polici said emphasi migrat rule criterion agrement acord ned stand firmli smugl ring ileg migrat grece ben wide acus migrant right group cari sumari deport peopl son reach grek soil without alow apli asylum ileg practic known pushback despit consider indic practic island grece land border turkey grek ofici strenuous deni ocursfolow ap global migrat coverag"}

To qualify, businesses must own the site.The typical Level II EV charger requires four to six hours to provide a full charge, but the units are excellent for \"topping off\" EVs while drivers eat meals at restaurants or hotels, watch a movie or shop.As one of the largest states in the country, Texas suffers from significant gaps in its existing and projected commercial electric vehicle infrastructure. McKinsey  Company reported that in the next five years, EV sales will double in the U.S. But, according to the U.S. Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center, Texas only has about 2,284 public EV station locations with 5,746 electric vehicle supply equipment ports that serve approximately 150,000 registered EVs in the state. Estimates for EV adoption and EV charger needs are for nearly exponential growth. In fact, the Texas Department of Transportation in its Texas Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan assumes one million EVs will be registered in Texas by 2028.\"Texans are buying EVs, but the rate will be dampened without access to public EV charging,\" said Hemal Doshi, CEO of Universal EV Chargers. \"Public EV chargers are now essential to the electrification of the state. We recognize that not all businesses can finance their public EV charging stations, which is why we are excited to provide these EV charging stations on suitable business sites throughout Texas to \"prime the pump\" for public EV charging. I am proud that Universal EV Chargers is doing its part to help provide Texans access to reliable and equitable public EV charging sites to spur electric vehicle adoption and growth.\"Universal EV Chargers' no-cost EV charging station offer requires that site owners provide public access, overnight guest access in the case of hotel properties or employee access at large office buildings. The EV user will pay for the electricity used like they would at traditional gasoline station pumps and Universal EV Chargers will reimburse site owners monthly for electricity used.How Commercial site owners can benefit from hosting public EV charging stationsPrime locations for public EV-charging stations\"Universal EV Chargers is making this generous offer for two reasons. First, we know that achieving optimal electrification in the U.S. will require new infrastructure, and second, we are willing to help businesses make the leap to EV charging faster,\" said Doshi. \"Once enough businesses have gained experience hosting EV charging stations to achieve critical mass, we expect the business community at large to accelerate adoption to the level required to support expected EV ownership growth.\"Universal Green Group, the parent company of Universal EV Chargers, was founded by green energy visionary Hemal Doshi in 2009 to contribute meaningfully to the United States' sustainable energy transition. Universal Solar System, the company's first business, has installed hundreds of solar energy systems for businesses and homeowners and built a solar farm in West Texas, which helps to fuel the Texas electricity grid. Universal EV Chargers is an EV charging solutions provider established to help fulfill Doshi's vision to electrify the auto industry by reimagining the electric vehicle (EV) charging station model in the U.S.Doshi hopes this offer will allow Texas businesses to experience the benefits of hosting an EV charging station and boost additional public charging services for Texas EV drivers quickly.Interested businesses can learn more about this offer and whether they qualify for the opportunity by calling (366) 350-2738 or visiting UniversalEVCharging.comAbout Universal EV Chargers, a Division of Universal Green GroupFounded in 2009, Universal Green Group is a national leader in sustainable green services, products, technology and projects.

This self-operating solution was implemented department-wide in the ICU, and no changes were made or required to the hospital's cleaning and disinfection practices, trainings or schedules. The study also concluded that the use of ActivePure's Advanced Photocatalysis technology in a Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resulted in a statistically significant 98 reduction of the levels of MRSA surface burden from baseline to final post-activation test.The study is now available via the Open Forum Infectious Diseases a publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and can be found here.\"Keeping patients and team members safe is the top priority for infection prevention and control, and as HAIs in healthcare continue to rise and occur.

LOUIS (AP) -- A red carpet, welcome signs, cheers and high fives welcomed students back Tuesday at Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis, nearly three months after a young gunman killed two people and injured seven others in a rampage inside the school.The Oct. 24 shooting was among the deadliest school shootings in the U.S. last year. Tenth-grader Alexzandria Bell and 61-year-old physical education teacher Jean Kuczka died before police killed the gunman, former student Orlando Harris, in an exchange of gunfire.Alexzandria's mother, Keisha Acres, joined teachers, faculty and administrators who stood outside the entrance Tuesday, offering encouragement to students returning for the first day of in-person classes since the shooting. Students had been learning online only.\"I'm overwhelmed but I'm here for the kids,\" Acres said. \"So it's not about me, it's about them.\"Some kids exchanged high fives and smiles. Others walked stoically through the crowd of well-wishers. A few shielded their faces from the cameras.Principal Kacy Shahid said the school now has armed security. Therapists and other support services are available. Bullet-riddled walls have been fixed and painted.\"That incident that happened Oct. 24 does not define who we are as a school,\" Shahid said.It was among 51 school shootings in the U.S. last year that resulted in injuries or deaths, according to tracking by Education Week. The deadly attacks included the killings of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in May.Manfret McGhee is dean of arts at the St. Louis school, and a parent. His 16-year-old son was among those shot. McGhee said the boy is recovering well \"physically as well as emotionally\" and was among the returning students.\"I actually feel good that we're getting back to business,\" McGhee said. \"I'm one of the ones who feel that it's important to get back to a sense of normalcy.\"Patrice Hill, parent of another junior, also believes her daughter will benefit from a return to school.\"She's a kid. She's 16. Hopefully she can become -- I don't want to say normal -- but OK with being back around everyone,\" Hill said.Harris, 19, had a long history of mental health problems. Police said relatives monitored his mail and often checked his room to make sure he did not have a weapon.In fact, Harris' mother called police on Oct. 15 after she found an AR-15-style rifle and wanted it removed. Missouri does not have a red-flag law aimed at keeping firearms away from people who may be a danger to themselves or others. As a result, officers \"did not have clear authority to temporarily seize the rifle when they responded to the suspect's home when called by the suspect's mother on 10/15/22,\" police said in a statement days after the shooting.Instead, someone known to the family was contacted and took the gun. Somehow, Harris was able to get it back.The school was locked, with seven unarmed guards at the doors, on the morning of Oct. 24, school leaders have said. One of the guards initially became alarmed when he saw Harris trying to get in one of the doors.That guard alerted school officials and made sure police were contacted. Harris managed to get inside -- police have not disclosed exactly how. Police said he had around 600 rounds of ammunition with him.Gunfire inside the building forced students to barricade doors and huddle in classroom corners, jump from windows and run out of the building to seek safety. Several people inside the school said they heard Harris warn, \"You are all going to die!\"Police officers, some of them off-duty, arrived within four minutes of the 911 call. Amid the chaos, officers found the gunman on the third floor, barricaded in a classroom. Police said that when Harris shot at officers, they shot back and broke through the door, killing Harris. He had ammunition strapped to his chest and in a bag. Other magazines were found dumped in stairwells.Harris graduated from the school in 2021. In a note left behind, he lamented that he had no friends, no family, no girlfriend and a life of isolation. His note called it the \"perfect storm for a mass shooter.\"Central Visual and Performing Arts shares a building with another magnet school, Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience, which also was evacuated as the shooting unfolded. Central has around 380 students, Collegiate around 340. Collegiate students returned to class Nov. 28.", "normalized_body": "st loui ap red carpet welcom sign cher high five welcom student back tuesday central visual art perform art high schol st loui nearli thre month young gunman kile two peopl injur seven other rampag insid scholth oct shote among deadliest schol shote u last year tenthgrad alexzandria bel 0yearold physic educ teacher jean kuczka die polic kile gunman former student orlando hari exchang gunfirealexzandria mother keisha acr join teacher faculti administr stod outsid entranc tuesday ofer encourag student return first day inperson clase sinc shote student ben learn onlin im overwhelm im kid acr said  kid exchang high five smile other walk stoicali crowd welwish shield face camerasprincip kaci shahid said schol arm secur therapist suport servic avail buletridl wal ben fix paint incid hapen oct defin schol shahid saidit among schol shote u last year result injuri death acord track educ wek deadli atack includ kile child two teacher rob elementari schol uvald texa maymanfret mcghe dean art st loui schol parent 0yearold son among shot mcghe said boy recov wel physicali wel emotionali among return student actuali fel god gete back busin mcghe said im one one fel import get back sen normalci patric hil parent anoth junior also believ daughter wil benefit return schol she kid she hopefuli becom dont want say normal ok back around everyon hil saidhari long histori mental health problem polic said rel monitor mail often check rom make sure weaponin fact hari mother cale polic oct found ar0styl rifl want remov misouri redflag law aim kepe firearm away peopl may danger other result ofic clear author temporarili seiz rifl respond suspect home cale suspect mother polic said statement day shotinginstead someon known famili contact tok gun somehow hari abl get backth schol lock seven unarm guard dor morn oct schol leader said one guard initiali becam alarm saw hari tri get one dorsthat guard alert schol ofici made sure polic contact hari manag get insid polic disclos exactli polic said around round amunit himgunfir insid build forc student baricad dor hudl clasrom corner jump window run build sek safeti sever peopl insid schol said heard hari warn al go die polic ofic ofduti ariv within four minut cal amid chao ofic found gunman third flor baricad clasrom polic said hari shot ofic shot back broke dor kile hari amunit strape chest bag magazin found dump stairwelshari graduat schol note left behind lament friend famili girlfriend life isol note cale perfect storm ma shoter central visual perform art share build anoth magnet schol colegi schol medicin bioscienc also evacu shote unfold central around student colegi around colegi student return cla nov"}

Blumira Agent can be installed within minutes, equipping small teams with a centralized view of an organization's remote Windows devices that are sending logs to Blumira's platform for threat analysis, detection and response. Blumira Agent gives small IT teams the capability to immediately isolate devices, containing threats like ransomware to prevent a data breach.The rise in remote and hybrid work models has made it difficult for IT teams to gain visibility into the security of endpoints and their ability to protect their organizations against ransomware. Many endpoint agents today are resource-intensive and cumbersome, requiring on-premises infrastructure to set up and run, while often lacking in historical endpoint data retention to meet compliance and investigation needs. Meanwhile, the current economic climate is forcing many businesses to revise their financial models, stretching thin security and IT budgets that need to support endpoint security.To help SMBs with limited resources, Blumira Agent combines cloud-based security information and event management (SIEM) with endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. This delivers automated detection and response across organizations' IT environments, helping satisfy more compliance and cyber insurance requirements, including endpoint data retention for at least one year.The lightweight agent accelerates speed to security by providing frictionless, direct-to-cloud installation, with no additional infrastructure or intensive resources required to run the agent on a device. This makes it easy for small IT and security teams to support remote work, who can use Blumira Agent to quickly isolate infected or compromised endpoints with just a few clicks.The most significant barriers to achieving strong endpoint security are lack of visibility of all endpoints (63) and lack of in-house expertise (45), according to Ponemon's Managing Risks and Costs at the Edge Report. To support smaller organizations, Blumira's platform identifies and alerts customers to real indicators of attacker behavior within milliseconds, while expert-written playbooks walk customers through how to respond and contain a threat. In addition, Blumira's security operations team provides 24/7 support for critical priority issues.\"We're excited to launch Blumira Agent, as pairing an endpoint security tool with automated detection and response across an organization's network, users, and applications is essential for full 360-degree visibility,\" said Matt Warner, CTO and Co-Founder of Blumira. \"As ransomware continues to rise - targeting SMBs more than ever - it's become increasingly important for IT teams to have complete visibility and control of endpoints across their organizations' entire environment - including remote workstations and servers.\"Blumira Agent is available as an add-on feature for 6 per device per month to any of Blumira's paid editions - Microsoft 365, Cloud and Advanced.Learn more about Blumira Agent: https://www.blumira.com/blumira-agent and https://www.blumira.com/blumira-agent-explained/This video provides a technical demonstration:About BlumiraBlumira's mission is to help SMBs and mid-market companies detect and respond to cybersecurity threats faster to stop breaches and ransomware.

As the Vatican's finance minister for three years, Pell had been a key player in the early years of Pope Francis' papacy, whose goals included reforming the Holy See's finances, which had a long history of scandals and poor management.Pell returned to his native Australia in 2017 to be tried on child sex abuse charges over allegations that he molested two choirboys while he was archbishop of Melbourne. He served 404 days in solitary confinement before his convictions were overturned in 2020.Pell's funeral was held at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, with Francis imparting a final blessing.Pell will lie in St. Mary's from Feb. 1 before he is interred in the cathedral's crypt the next day, Sydney's Catholic Archdiocese said in a statement.Pell's successor as archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, will be the principal celebrant at the requiem Mass.St. Mary's Cathedral dean, the Rev. Don Richardson, said thousands of mourners were expected to attend the Mass.\"Cardinal Pell left a remarkable legacy for the Catholic Church in Australia and this will undoubtedly be one of the most significant funerals ever held at the cathedral,\" Richardson said in a statement.The Mass will be livestreamed by the cathedral to allow mourners around the world to participate in the ceremony, which will also be shown on large screens outside.", "normalized_body": "sydney ap highrank australian cardin spent year prison child abus convict quash apeal wil inter feb requiem ma sydney st mari cathedr church said tuesdaycardin georg pel die jan shortli undergo hip surgeri rome hospit vatican financ minist thre year pel ben key player earli year pope franci papaci whose goal includ reform holi se financ long histori scandal por managementpel return nativ australia tri child sex abus charg aleg molest two choirboy archbishop melbourn serv day solitari confin convict overturn 0pel funer held st peter basilica saturday franci impart final blesingpel wil lie st mari feb inter cathedr crypt next day sydney cathol archdioces said statementpel sucesor archbishop sydney anthoni fisher wil princip celebr requiem masst mari cathedr dean rev richardson said thousand mourner expect atend ma cardin pel left remark legaci cathol church australia wil undoubtedli one signific funer ever held cathedr richardson said statementth ma wil livestream cathedr alow mourner around world particip ceremoni wil also shown larg scren outsid"}

The 37-year-old British road champion and cycling great Eddy Merckx currently top the all-time list with 34 stage wins.\"The joy of riding my bike and the hunger to continue winning are as bright as ever,\" Cavendish said in a statement provided by Astana on Tuesday. \"As always, the objective will be for us to stand on the top podium.\"Cavendish equaled Merckx's record at the 2021 Tour de France, 13 years after his first stage win. Cavendish -- who has never won the Tour, unlike five-time champion Merckx -- was not selected for last year's edition by his former Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl team.Astana is managed by former Olympic road champion Alexander Vinokourov. Adding a big name like Cavendish's to its roster is a welcome move for the team following the retirement of Vincenzo Nibali, and the firing in December of Miguel Angel Lopez for his alleged links with a doctor suspected of drug trafficking.\"He is the best sprinter of all time,\" Vinokourov said about Cavendish. \"The arrival of a top sprinter in our team is kind of a challenge for us, but we are ready for it. The goals however are still the same -- victories in any kind of race: classics, stages in different stage races and, of course, in the Grand Tours. Mark still has a big desire to win.\"Known as \"The Manx Missile\" because he comes from the Isle of Man, Cavendish also won the Tour de France best sprinter's green jersey twice. He has won stages at all three Grands Tours -- Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Spanish Vuelta -- and became a world champion in 2011.Vinokourov won the 2006 Spanish Vuelta and four individual stages at the Tour de France between 2003-10. He was banned for two years after testing positive for blood doping at the 2007 Tour but came back to win the men's road race at the 2012 London Olympics. He started his managerial career after retiring that year.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "normalized_body": "brusel ap veteran sprinter mark cavendish might stil get chanc claim outright record stage win tour de francecavendish join astanaqazaqstan extend stori carer one season wil hope ride kazakh team cycl bigest race juli 0yearold british road champion cycl great edi merckx curent top altim list stage win joy ride bike hunger continu wine bright ever cavendish said statement provid astana tuesday alway object wil u stand top podium cavendish equal merckx record tour de franc year first stage win cavendish never tour unlik fivetim champion merckx select last year edit former quickstep alpha vinyl teamastana manag former olymp road champion alexand vinokourov ade big name like cavendish roster welcom move team folow retir vincenzo nibali fire decemb miguel angel lopez aleg link doctor suspect drug trafick best sprinter al time vinokourov said cavendish ariv top sprinter team kind chaleng u readi goal howev stil victori kind race clasic stage difer stage race cours grand tour mark stil big desir win known manx misil come isl man cavendish also tour de franc best sprinter gren jersey twice stage al thre grand tour tour de franc giro ditalia spanish vuelta becam world champion 0vinokourov spanish vuelta four individu stage tour de franc betwen bane two year test posit blod dope tour came back win men road race london olymp start manageri carer retir yearmor ap sport"}

(AP) -- Arthur Ravenel, the former congressman and state lawmaker who helped build the Republican Party in South Carolina and get money for the graceful bridge that dominates the Charleston skyline and bears his name, has died. He was 95.His family announced in a short statement that he died Monday. The statement did not give a cause.Ravenel spent six decades in public service, elected to the state Senate, the state House and Congress. He also ran for governor and, late in life after retiring from the Senate, returned to public service as a member of the Charleston County School Board.The 632 million bridge over the Cooper River connecting Charleston to Mount Pleasant is named in his honor, a thank you for the years he spent in Washington trying to get money for an iconic span that would fit the charming city where he spent most of his life. Known to political friends and foes alike as Cousin Arthur, Ravenel's ancestors fought for the Confederacy, and during the heated debate over removing the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome in 2000, he once referred to the NAACP as the \"National Association for Retarded People,\" bringing calls for his resignation.He later voted to remove the flag from the dome and place a similar one at the Confederate Soldier Monument on Statehouse grounds. Ravenel defended his actions by saying he didn't have a racist bone in his body, and African American colleagues said he was willing at times to help get their bills passed.Ravenel recalled in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press that he was first elected to the House in 1952 as a Democrat when there were virtually no Republicans in the state.\"You just heard about Republicans,\" he quipped. \"Sherman was one.\"Ten years later, Ravenel got involved in the state's fledgling Republican Party and was a national convention delegate in 1964 when Barry Goldwater was nominated for president.Ravenel was elected to the state Senate as a Republican in 1980.\"The Democratic Party was getting more and more liberal,\" Ravenel recalled. \"As it got more liberal, we were able to recruit more and more people to run.\"In 1986, Ravenel was elected to Congress from the coastal 1st Congressional District. He left eight years later to seek the Governor's Mansion, but lost the GOP runoff to David Beasley, who went on to become governor.Two years later, Ravenel returned to the state Senate on a platform of creating an infrastructure bank to pay for costly highway projects. The bank was instrumental in helping build the Charleston bridge, which had been discussed for decades but for which money could not be found.Ravenel, a businessperson and private investor, loved the Senate above his other posts.\"You're dealing with people with soft Southern voices, and everyone is very polite,\" he recalled. \"It's small, and with 46 members, you can get something done.\"Ravenel had six children, including a son, Thomas, who was elected state treasurer in 2006 but resigned the following year after his indictment on drug charges.The younger Ravenel later pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison. He has spent his recent years as a star for five seasons on the reality television show \"Southern Charm,\" which chronicles Charleston socialites. ___Bruce Smith, a longtime Associated Press journalist who retired in 2016, was the principal writer of this obituary.

The incident quickly escalated tensions between the neighbors and reflected the heightened sensitivity around the sacred compound under Israel's new ultranationalist government. Jordan's Foreign Ministry said its ambassador to Israel, Ghassan Majali, was blocked from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem's Old City, the third-holiest site in Islam. The site, sitting on a sprawling plateau also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, is revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount. The compound is administered by Jordanian religious authorities as part of an unofficial agreement after Israel won control of east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel is in charge of security at the site.The Israeli police said that Majali arrived at the holy site \"without any prior coordination with police officials,\" prompting an officer at the compound entrance who didn't recognize the diplomat to notify his commander about the unexpected visit. While awaiting instructions, officers held up Majali, along with Azzam al-Khatib, the director of the Jerusalem Waqf. The ambassador refused to wait and decided to leave, Israeli police said. Some two hours later, Jordanian state-run media reported that Majali finally entered the compound without showing any kind of permission and held talks with al-Khatib, who \"briefed him about the Israeli violations in Al-Aqsa.\"Footage widely shared online shows Majali, among other Muslim worshippers, at the limestone Lion's Gate entrance to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City. An Israeli police officer blocks his path and yells at Majali in Arabic to go back, according to the video. Al-Khatib gets on the phone as the visitors argue with the officers amid the crackle of the policeman's walkie-talkie.\"Had the ambassador briefly waited a few more minutes for the officer to be updated, the group would have entered,\" the police said, stressing that \"coordination\" with Israeli police was routine ahead of such visits. But Jordan described the move as an unusual provocation. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry said the Israeli ambassador had received a \"strongly worded letter of protest to be conveyed immediately to his government.\" It said Jordanian officials do not need permission to enter the site because of the country's role as the official custodian and cautioned Israel against taking \"any actions that would prejudice the sanctity of the holy places.\"There was no immediate comment from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Tuesday marked the second time that Jordan has summoned the Israeli ambassador to Amman since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new right-wing and religiously conservative government took power. Earlier this month, Israel's minister of national security, the ultranationalist Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the Jerusalem holy site despite threats from the Hamas militant group and a cascade of condemnations from across the Arab world. Jordan, along with the Palestinians and many Muslims, views Israeli visits to the compound as an attempt to alter the status of the site and give Jewish worshipers more rights there. Ben-Gvir and other far-right ministers who vow a hard-line stance against the Palestinians have threatened to test Israel's ties with Arab states -- including Jordan and Egypt that have maintained decades-long peace treaties with Israel.On Tuesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi hosted Jordanian and Palestinian leaders for talks on the state of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a joint statement, el-Sissi, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for Israel to halt \"all illegitimate, unilateral measures\" that undermine the creation of an independent Palestinian state and to maintain the status quo at the Noble Sanctuary. The smallest change at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound -- one of the region's most contested sites -- could become a major new flashpoint between Israel and the Muslim world. Past Israeli actions there have triggered violent protests and wider conflicts.___Associated Press writers Omar Akour in Amman, Jordan, and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.

(\"Engine\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:GAME)(TSXV:GAME), a data-driven, gaming, media and influencer marketing platform company, today announced results for its fiscal first quarter 2023 ended November 30, 2022. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.Financial Highlights:Management Commentary\"We are proud of the continued improvement we have made towards our near-term goal of achieving cash-flow breakeven. This quarter is highlighted by a 65 improvement in net loss of nearly 10 million and a 32 improvement in Adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis to (2.7) million, despite the restructuring charges related to discontinued operations said Lou Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Engine. \"Despite some expected short-term headwinds in the advertising market, driven by Google algorithm changes, we continue to see heightened demand for our influencer and data technology SaaS services by our gaming and brand clients, which grew 35 YoY. We see this as a welcoming trend heading into our merger with GameSquare.\"Tom Rogers, Executive Chairman of the Company, commented on the recently announced merger with GameSquare, adding, \"Our strengths speak to the heart of the thesis behind the GameSquare transaction. GameSquare brings content development, a publisher advertising network, and a gaming influencer network, which is complementary to our gaming content analytics technology, our programmatic advertising technology, and our influencer marketing and management technology. When the two companies' assets are combined, these elements create an end-to-end solution for brands to reach their target audience. Moreover, the combined companies offering provides a highly scaled answer to reach younger demographics at a level sought by brands, which traditional media can no longer perform. In addition, digital advertising continues to be constrained by new privacy protection steps of the major tech players, which has inhibited efficient targeting of certain audiences particularly gaming audiences. Traditional media's failings and digital advertising limitations create the setting for why the combined company provides a solution to both problems that is both differentiated and scalable.\"Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2023 was 10.3 million, compared to revenue of 11.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. Overall Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues were relatively flat due to the declines in legacy content management related SaaS revenues. However, gaming and influencer data and analytics SaaS revenues grew 34.6 YoY. The decrease in advertising revenues was primarily due to changes in Google discovery and algorithms which impacted audience traffic that is expected to gradually improve throughout the fiscal second quarter and fiscal third quarter of 2023.Expenses in the fiscal first quarter were 15.8 million, an improvement of approximately 6.0 million, when compared to 21.8 million on a sequential basis.Net Loss in the fiscal first quarter improved 64.7 to 5.4 million, compared to a net loss of 15.2 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 inclusive of the restructuring charges related to discontinued operations.Adjusted EBITDA was (2.7) million for the fiscal first quarter, an improvement of 32.5 when compared to (4.0) million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, and when compared to the same year-ago quarter Adjusted EBITDA improved 17.5.At November 30, 2022, the Company had cash of 6.9 million.Recent Operational Highlights:FY Q1 2023 Earnings Conference CallManagement will host an investor conference call at 8:45 a.m. EDT (5:45 a.m. PDT) today, Tuesday, January 17, 2023, to discuss Engine Gaming and Media, Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2023 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with a QA from participants. To participate, please use the following information:Please dial in at least 10 minutes before the start of the call to ensure timely participation.Non-IFRS MeasuresThe Company reports earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to net income (loss) or any other financial measures of performance or liquidity calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing operating results. The Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA internally for purposes of forecasting, determining compensation, and assessing the performance of our business, therefore, we believe this measure provides useful supplemental information that may assist investors in assessing an investment in the Company.The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.NoteNet income (loss) attributable to owners of the CompanyInterest expenseAmortization and depreciation(a)Restructuring costsShare-based payments(a)Loss on foreign exchangeGain on modification of debt(a)Transaction costsArbitration settlement reserve(a)Change in fair value of promissory notes receivable(a)Change in fair value of warrant liability(a)Change in fair value of convertible debt(a)(Gain) loss from discontinued operationsAdjusted EBITDAAbout Engine Gaming and Media, Inc.Engine Gaming and Media, Inc.

The revenue share only applies to revenue in excess of a guaranteed amount which is the minimum paid to NuRAN. A penetration rate reduction factor has been used to mitigate risk. The base data used to calculate the total potential revenue of this agreement was provided by Orange based on average population, penetration rate and ARPU. Management of the Company believes that the estimates have been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting best estimates and judgments, and based on a number of assumptions management believes are reasonable as well as information provided to the Company by Orange.

He's tackling a new one in Cleveland.Schwartz, who took a winless Detroit team to the playoff in three seasons, has been hired as the Browns' defensive coordinator, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Tuesday.Schwartz spent the past two seasons as a defensive adviser for Tennessee. The 56-year-old was one of four candidates to meet with the Browns, who went 7-10 this season and had defensive issues from the opener. He previously worked with Cleveland general manager Andrew Berry in Philadelphia.Cleveland's search for a coordinator began last week when coach Kevin Stefanski fired Joe Woods after three seasons.The Browns also met with Steelers assistant Brian Flores, Seahawks associate head coach Sean Desai and Eagles passing game coordinator Dennard Wilson.Schwartz was by far the most experienced candidate, and his familiarity with the 4-3 defensive scheme aligns with Cleveland's preference and the club's personnel. Known for a fiery demeanor, Schwartz also will provide some balance to the Browns staff under the even-keeled Stefanski.Schwartz began his pro career as a scout with Cleveland in the 1990s. He'll take over the Browns' defense once he signs his contract, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because that hasn't happened yet.Schwartz previously worked as a coordinator with the Titans (8 seasons), Bills (1) and Eagles (5). He won a Super Bowl running Philadelphia's defense in 2017.One of Schwartz's top priorities will be fixing Cleveland's run defense. The Browns allowed 135 yards per game under Woods, who was unable to get the most out of a group led by star defensive end Myles Garrett.The Browns need to upgrade their defensive front in the offseason for Schwartz, who always has had big run-stuffing tackles.When Schwartz was with Buffalo in 2014, the Bills led the league in sacks and finished fourth in yards allowed. During the Super Bowl season in Philadelphia, the Eagles ranked first against the run (79.2) and were fourth in takeaways (31).___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "normalized_body": "cleveland ap jim schwartz never ben afraid big chaleng he tackl new one clevelandschwartz tok winl detroit team playof thre season ben hire brown defens cordin person familiar decis told asoci pre tuesdayschwartz spent past two season defens advis tenes 0yearold one four candid met brown went season defens isu open previous work cleveland gener manag andrew beri philadelphiacleveland search cordin began last wek coach kevin stefanski fire joe wod thre seasonsth brown also met steler asist brian flore seahawk asoci head coach sean desai eagl pase game cordin denard wilsonschwartz far experienc candid familiar defens scheme align cleveland prefer club personel known fieri demeanor schwartz also wil provid balanc brown staf evenkel stefanskischwartz began pro carer scout cleveland 0 hel take brown defens sign contract acord person spoke ap condit anonym hasnt hapen yetschwartz previous work cordin titan season bil eagl super bowl rune philadelphia defens 0one schwartz top prioriti wil fix cleveland run defens brown alow yard per game wod unabl get group led star defens end myle garetth brown ned upgrad defens front ofseason schwartz alway big runstuf tackleswhen schwartz bufalo bil led leagu sack finish fourth yard alow super bowl season philadelphia eagl rank first run fourth takeaway 0ap nfl"}

The flat, square block of brownish sandstone has carved scribbles, which may be the earliest example of words recorded in writing in Scandinavia, the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo said. It said it was \"among the oldest runic inscriptions ever found\" and \"the oldest datable runestone in the world.\" \"This find will give us a lot of knowledge about the use of runes in the early Iron Age. This may be one of the first attempts to use runes in Norway and Scandinavia on stone,\" Kristel Zilmer, a professor at University of Oslo, of which the museum is part, told The Associated Press. Older runes have been found on other items, but not on stone. The earliest runic find is on a bone comb found in Denmark. Zilmer said that maybe the tip of knife or a needle was used to carve the runes.The runestone was discovered in the fall of 2021 during an excavation of a grave near Tyrifjord, west of Oslo, in a region known for several monumental archaeological finds. Items in the cremation pit -- burnt bones and charcoal -- indicate that the runes likely were inscribed between A.D. 1 and 250. \"We needed time to analyze and date the runestone,\" she said to explain why the finding was first announced on Tuesday. Measuring 31 centimeters by 32 centimeters (12.2 inches by 12.6 inches), the stone has several types of inscriptions and not all make linguistic sense. Eight runes on the front of the stone read \"idiberug\" -- which could be the name of a woman, a man or a family. Zilmer called the discovery \"the most sensational thing that I, as an academic, have had.\" There is still a lot of research to be done on the rock, dubbed the Svingerud stone after the site where it was found. \"Without doubt, we will obtain valuable knowledge about the early history of runic writing,\" Zilmer said.The runestone will be exhibited for a month, starting on Jan. 21, at the Museum of Cultural History, which has Norway's largest collection of historical artifacts, from the Stone Age to modern times. Runes are the characters in several Germanic alphabets that were used in northern Europe from ancient times until the adoption of the Latin alphabet.

Actually, it is a rather common refrain among tennis players as they move from stop to stop on the tour, even ones as successful as No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek.They insist it is important to remain blissfully unaware of any potential path to a title and offer various reasons, ranging from superstition to an insistence on -- yes, you probably guessed it -- that old cliche about \"playing one match at a time.\"\"I didn't really see the draw,\" three-time major champion Swiatek said last weekend, before play began. \"I only know who I'm playing (in the) first round.\"They haven't glanced at the bracket, they say.They won't, they say.And they absolutely, positively, do not want anyone else -- a coach, an agent, a physical therapist, a hitting partner, a friend or (heaven forbid!) a journalist -- sneaking a peek and revealing what the draw sheet might hold in store.It can't be easy to avoid knowing more than that, given all of the attention on the tournament and the giant bracket posted on the side of Rod Laver Arena, where Swiatek won her first-round match Monday night.As No. 5-seeded Aryna Sabalenka pointed out, social media makes keeping blinders on tough, too. Talk of a player's path to a championship is constant.\"Someone is going to post a prediction (of) who I'm going to play, so, anyway, I would see that,\" said Sabalenka, who takes on Shelby Rogers of the U.S. on Thursday. \"I'm not opening the draw and trying to see, 'OK, I'm going to face that, that, that.' No, no, no, I'm not doing that. I'm just trying to take it one step at a time.\"There are 128 entrants in the women's singles event at each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and another 128 in the men's singles. It takes getting past seven rounds to earn the trophy.So it seems as if it might be the sensible -- even advisable -- approach to be fully aware of what, of who, could lie ahead.Which is why some, such as Frances Tiafoe, the 24-year-old American seeded 16th, thinks it's nonsense for players to say they are not aware of what's out there.\"Everyone who says they don't (know), they're lying, man,\" said Tiafoe, a semifinalist at last year's U.S. Open. \"You know who's around. You know what the potential matchups look like. But you can't make those potential matchups unless you take care of the food that's in front of you.\"No. 6 seed Felix-Auger Aliassime, for one, acknowledged as much.\"I don't refuse to look; I look a little bit further down the draw,\" Auger-Aliassime said. \"But it still doesn't change that I'm totally focused and locked in on the first match I have to play. I've had great moments in Grand Slams, but also some very tough moments -- losing earlier, like first or second round -- so I'm always aware that you never can take anything for granted.\"Swiatek says she used to check out the draw but now she doesn't.Same for Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who is 113th in the ATP rankings.\"I used to look ahead. I used to look at every kind of step of the draw when the draw came out. I've kind of stopped that. I'm trying to take it one match at a time. Just focus on the match ahead, not look forward to the second or third round or fourth round,\" Popyrin said. \"It's not the best to look ahead when you haven't even done the first step. For me, that was a learning process.\"Don't look now, but Popyrin is slated to meet No. 8 seed Taylor Fritz of the U.S. in the second round after both won their opening matches.___Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at https://twitter.com/HowardFendrich___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "normalized_body": "melbourn australia ap await new topic preaustralian open news confer carolin garcia someon skile smart enough reach u open semifin win seasonend wta final wori next queri could involv name posibl opon dont want know draw garcia blurt rais left hand literali deflect subject dont know draw hardli athlet make claim melbourn park year first grand slam tournament second round begin wednesday actuali rather comon refrain among teni player move stop stop tour even one suces 0rank iga swiatekthey insist import remain blisfuli unawar potenti path titl ofer variou reason rang superstit insist ye probabl gues old clich play one match time didnt reali se draw thretim major champion swiatek said last wekend play began know im play first round havent glanc bracket saythey wont sayand absolut posit want anyon el coach agent physic therapist hite partner friend heaven forbid journalist sneak pek reveal draw shet might hold storeit cant easi avoid know given al atent tournament giant bracket post side rod laver arena swiatek firstround match monday nighta 0sede aryna sabalenka point social medium make kepe blinder tough talk player path championship constant someon go post predict im go play anyway would se said sabalenka take shelbi roger u thursday im open draw tri se ok im go face im im tri take one step time entrant woman singl event four grand slam tournament anoth men singl take gete past seven round earn trophyso sem might sensibl even advis aproach fuli awar could lie aheadwhich franc tiafo 0yearold american sede 0th think nonsens player say awar what everyon say dont know theyr lie man said tiafo semifinalist last year u open know who around know potenti matchup lok like cant make potenti matchup unl take care fod that front youno sed felixaug aliasim one acknowledg much dont refus lok lok litl bit draw augeraliasim said stil doesnt chang im totali focus lock first match play ive great moment grand slam also tough moment lose earlier like first second round im alway awar never take anyth grant swiatek say use check draw doesntsam alexei popyrin australian 0th atp rank use lok ahead use lok everi kind step draw draw came ive kind stope im tri take one match time focu match ahead lok forward second third round fourth round popyrin said best lok ahead havent even done first step learn proce dont lok popyrin slate met sed taylor fritz u second round open matchesfolow howard fendrich twiter teni"}

Wasantha Mudalige was brought before a magistrate in Colombo on Tuesday who ordered him to be remanded until Jan. 31. Seven human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, said that under the powerful Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has been used since 1979, courts routinely deny bail if it's opposed by the attorney general. Mudalige is the convenor of the Inter-University Students' Federation and was involved in months of anti-government demonstrations last year. The protesters demanded wide-ranging reforms to resolve the economic crisis that caused severe shortages of essential goods, fuel and medicine after Sri Lanka defaulted on its massive debt. The protests culminated in the flight and resignation of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa after thousands of people stormed his residence in July. His successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, initiated talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package that is contingent on reforms and debt restructuring. Wickremesinghe's government also gave sweeping powers to the authorities to crack down on the protests, arresting scores of activists. Rights groups say the military has sought to curtail protests through intimidation, surveillance and arbitrary arrests since Wickremesinghe took office in July.Many of those detained have been released on bail, but the rights group say authorities have used extraordinary powers to keep Mudalige in detention despite having produced no evidence of his involvement in terrorism. The groups said in a statement Monday that for much of the time, Mudalige has been held in \"solitary confinement and poor conditions, which can violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment under international human rights law.\"Mudalige was also arrested and jailed for more than three months in 2021 after protesting for the right to free education.For months, opposition lawmakers, rights and student activists have been demanding the release of Mudalige and an end to the government crackdown on demonstrations linked to the economic crisis. Government spokespeople did not immediately return a call seeking comment on Mudalige. The rights groups also urged the government to repeal the anti-terror law, which allows for up to a year of detention without charge on the orders of the defense minister, a position currently held by Wickremesinghe.In March, the government introduced some reforms to the anti-terror law. However, opposition and rights groups called them cosmetic and said the law still allows the detention of suspects without warrants and the use of confessions obtained through torture. They say the law, introduced during the country's civil war in 1979, has been widely abused, causing a large number of innocent people to spend years in prison without trial.Wickremesinghe was elected by Parliament to complete Rajapaksa's term, which ends in 2024. He is unpopular because he is supported by lawmakers who are still backed by the Rajapaksa family, which ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. Many accuse Wickremesinghe of protecting the Rajapaksas, who are widely blamed for corruption and misrule that led to the crisis.Sri Lanka is effectively bankrupt and has suspended repayment of nearly 7 billion in foreign debt due this year pending the outcome of talks with the IMF. The country's total foreign debt exceeds 51 billion, of which 28 billion has to be repaid by 2027.", "normalized_body": "colombo sri lanka ap human right group urg sri lanka govern releas promin student activist arest five month ago antigovern protest triger countri worst econom crisi ben held without charg harsh antiteror law wasantha mudalig brought magistr colombo tuesday order remand jan seven human right group includ amnesti intern human right watch said power prevent teror act ben use sinc court routin deni bail opos atorney gener mudalig convenor interunivers student feder involv month antigovern demonstr last year protest demand widerang reform resolv econom crisi caus sever shortag esenti god fuel medicin sri lanka default masiv debt protest culmin flight resign thenpresid gotabaya rajapaksa thousand peopl storm resid juli sucesor ranil wickremesingh initi talk intern monetari fund bailout packag conting reform debt restructur wickremesingh govern also gave swepe power author crack protest arest score activist right group say militari sought curtail protest intimid surveil arbitrari arest sinc wickremesingh tok ofic julymani detain ben releas bail right group say author use extraordinari power kep mudalig detent despit produc evid involv teror group said statement monday much time mudalig ben held solitari confin por condit violat prohibit tortur iltreat intern human right law mudalig also arest jail thre month protest right fre educationfor month oposit lawmak right student activist ben demand releas mudalig end govern crackdown demonstr link econom crisi govern spokespeopl imedi return cal seke coment mudalig right group also urg govern repeal antiteror law alow year detent without charg order defens minist posit curent held wickremesinghein march govern introduc reform antiteror law howev oposit right group cale cosmet said law stil alow detent suspect without warant use confes obtain tortur say law introduc countri civil war ben wide abus caus larg number inoc peopl spend year prison without trialwickremesingh elect parliament complet rajapaksa term end unpopular suport lawmak stil back rajapaksa famili rule sri lanka past two decad mani acus wickremesingh protect rajapaksa wide blame corupt misrul led crisissri lanka efect bankrupt suspend repay nearli bilion foreign debt due year pend outcom talk imf countri total foreign debt exc bilion bilion repaid"}

Acquires Ying Inc.", "article_date": "January 17, 2023 GMT", "article_author": "no author", "article_link": "https://apnews.com/article/accesswire-business-1cf33c69e9a1cffeb4382c628a036552", "article_body": "WASHINGTON, DC / ACCESSWIRE / January 17, 2023 / R3T Technologies is pleased to announce the acquisition of YING Inc., an advanced group skillsharing platform powered by AI and designed to unlock cultural, community, and financial capital.Ying, which has been under development for seven years, has now become the right tool at the right time in addressing the \"gig economy\". Why? US government statistics have confirmed that the \"gig economy\" or \"sharing economy\" is exploding, as more people seek direct access to find work, share resources and skills with one another. There are currently around 60 million gig workers, approximately 36 of all US employees. Statista projects that 85.6 million people will be doing freelance work in the US by 2027. According to Thrivemyway.com, by 2023, the size of the gig economy could reach 455.2 billion. ADP Research Institute says that in 6 of US companies gig workers make up as much as 85 of the workforce. At the same time, according to the Pew Institute, a significant number of Americans are seeking ways to feel like they belong and are looking for offerings that provide a sense of community.YING's focus on building intentional communities and bringing about a sense of \"the village\" is well-aligned with these both trends, and all research points to significant likelihood of market success. YING, which recently launched a neighborhood activation called VillageYING in Philadelphia and Boulder, Colorado, is dedicated to building intentional communities and empowering people to share their skills and resources with one another directly, without need of an employment agency, temp agency, or any other \"middleman\", thus bypassing traditional barriers to direct and immediate employment.\"It's clear that in this economy, we will need to leverage technologies to create more effective ways of unlocking the value we have within our own trusted networks to share resources and micro gigs,\" said Hope Sullivan, a board member of R3T. \"We are thrilled to have found such a strong business model in YING, and believe that its combination of fintech and valuing human capital is what differentiates Ying from any business model we've seen like it to date.\"Ying is a cutting-edge group skillsharing platform with \"intentional technology\" to unlock community, financial and social capital. This is possible via the in-app currency, the \"Balance Coin\" as well as fiat currency, all of which is kept accurate by usage of the block chain for all transactions.Ying is FREE for users, with Ying taking a small percentage of the agreed upon consideration between the two bilateral parties (a job seeker  employer, for instance). Due to its noted exceptional improvement in intra-company communications, for larger corporations, there is a monthly fee, which is expected to be a significant component of revenue stream.CEO Karla Ballard was quoted as saying \"We've been working hard for quite some time and now believe the marketplace is seeking exactly this type of economic solution in a fintech tool that unlocks opportunities to earn a better living. I am thrilled to be in position for us to bring this to the market under R3T.\"The acquisition of YING by R3T represents a major milestone for both companies, and we believe it will create new opportunities for growth and innovation. Management is aware of the current \"yield sign\" appearing on OTC markets and is working with new firm of CPAs to properly revise the 3rd Quarter report and hope to have it published shortly. By now bringing this technology public, we are confident that we can unlock even more value for our customers and shareholders, and help to build stronger, more resilient communities as we inter-connect, one gig and community at a time.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Gerber, author of The E-Myth Revisited, founder of Michel E. Gerber Companies, and the world's 1 small business guru, according to Inc. Magazine.With its focus on emerging franchisors, ZorForum mastermind groups help franchise founders and executive leaders get it right the first time, setting their business format franchise systems up for long-term sustainability. While Gerber's \" Dreaming Room \" groups are focused on more established business owners, the fundamental goal remains the same - to help \"lonely at the top\" business leaders become the masters of their universes, using the timeless principles espoused in The E-Myth.Gerber says he's aligned with ZorForum's co-founder (Stan Friedman and his partners, Graham Chapman, Dave Pazgan and Eric Mayers) to help business format franchising \"heal itself.\"\"Today, only 16 percent of U.S. franchises have more than 100 units, and a mere 4 percent have 500-plus locations. That to me, suggests a problem,\" said Gerber. \"In fact, only twelve percent fall into the 100-to-500-unit range, while a mere 11 percent have between 25 and 50 locations. This is across the board, across all verticals, not just a single market sector or geographic locale with an issue or problem. No, this is a fundamental, Business Format Franchising issue that I believe requires attention.\"\"The path to a healthy, efficient, and profitable franchise system exists within the comprehensive hub of resources made possible via this new alliance partnership with ZorForum,\" Gerber continued. \"We will work together to help countless franchise leaders transform their perspective and treat business format franchising as a \"mindset,\" as opposed to just a business model. The sky's the limit for any ZorForum or Dreaming Room group members as they'll quickly access - and implement - the systems, processes, and tools required to support franchise operations at scale.\"Stan Friedman, ZorForum Co-Founder and Managing Member, says he's been a student of Gerber's E-Myth principles for scaling franchise companies for sustainable growth, for more than 30 years.\"I could not be any prouder about joining forces with the iconic Michael E. Gerber to pay it forward for others,\" said Friedman. \"Far too many franchisors today have failed to create or abide by systems which embrace and support the basic tenets of Business Format Franchising, much less appropriate best practices. A much better scenario would be for franchisors to view their franchised offerings, systems, and tools as products themselves, which are just as important to the success of franchisees as the core offerings they make available to their customers.\"Friedman went on to say that doing so would enable franchisees to be more 'systems reliant,' than 'people dependent,' and as such they could spend more time working ON, not IN their businesses, as Michael E. Gerber's methodology and philosophy has become famous for communicating worldwide.\"As an initial, and critical step in their collective mission to awaken those new to business format franchising and/or to the lessons of The E-Myth, ZorForum will present \"A ZorForum Masterclass: The E-Myth Franchisor with Michael E. Gerber\" at 1PM EST on Thursday, February 16, 2023. This live program will be available to anyone in franchise leadership, from emerging all the way to the enterprise level.\"As franchisors begin planning their upcoming IFA Convention experience, just weeks out, when is a better time than now for them to be certain that they are dialed in to the things that really matter in their business,\" said Friedman. \"When better than now to hear from Michael E. Gerber, the Master of Transformation, and either affirm that they are on the right course, or help them chart a new course, away from the status quo or worse, to one that would more likely lead them to the Promised Land.\"Register today at this link https://zorforum.webinargeek.com/the-e-myth-franchisor-with-michael-e-gerber.

Dave Pazgan was member of that group. Today, Stan Friedman, Graham Chapman and Eric Mayers have joined Pazgan and morphed ZorForum into a network of peer groups custom-built for emerging franchisors.These groups, moderated by ZorForum franchisees, all industry pros themselves like John \"Johnny Franchise\" Francis and Gerry Henley, will participate in monthly Forum style peer meetings that also feature networking opportunities for its members.

(TSXV:FFOX)(OTCQB:FFOXF)(\"FireFox\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report results from the first three drill holes of the fall 2022 core drilling campaign at the Company's 100-held Mustajarvi Gold Project in Lapland, Finland. These three holes were part of a six-hole program (977.1 metres) that tested a new near-surface high-grade gold zone at the East Target (see Figure 1). All three of the holes returned high-grade gold assays, including some of the richest intercepts yet reported from the project.Drillholes 22MJ021 and 22MJ022 both encountered significant high-grade gold at depths of less than 20 metres below surface. The best intercept in this round of results was 15.5m of 13.09 g/t gold in 22MJ021, which began just below the covering glacial sediments at 11m downhole depth. Importantly, these holes were drilled perpendicular to the drilling orientation favoured in the previous campaigns and appear to have successfully confirmed that the observed cross-structures host significant mineralization.FireFox's CEO, Carl Lofberg, commented, \"Our drilling at Mustajarvi East is yielding consistent improvement in grade and thickness of the gold mineralization. In addition to the continued presence of narrow bonanza veins, our most recent drillholes have encountered replacement style mineralization over greater widths than previously seen on the project. It also happens that these new robust intercepts lie at very shallow depths in the East Target. By drilling these new holes towards the northeast, we have expanded the footprint of the high-grade system to the west, to the north, and to depth. We anticipate results from two more holes in the East Target in a few weeks.\"Highlights of selected intervals are shown below, while Table 1 includes all significant intercepts:This drilling was prompted by the extraordinary results from drill hole 22MJ006, which returned 13.85m averaging 28.74 g/t gold from only 24 metres downhole (see Company news release dated September 6, 2022 ). Drill holes 22MJ021 and 22MJ022 were drilled perpendicular to 22MJ006 to test for lateral and downdip extension of the 22MJ006 mineralization. The third drill hole in this phase of work, 22MJ023, tested the expansion of the mineralized trend farther to the north. All three drill holes returned multiple significant intercepts including high-grade gold mineralization that are expected to expand the East Target laterally and at depth.Figure 1 - Mustajarvi East Target Oct 2022 Drilling (Click here to enlarge)Mustajarvi Project and Drill Program DetailsThe Mustajarvi Project lies along the highway between the cities of Kittila and Sodankyla, approximately 17 kilometres east of Kittila. The property straddles the Mustajarvi Shear Zone (MSZ), a major right-lateral shear zone that has associated second and third-order structures which further dissect the project into separate structural zones. The Sodankyla Group rocks, which are primarily to the north of the shear zone in the footwall, include metamorphosed sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks. Geophysics and drilling have identified an extensive corridor of albite - sericite alteration in the footwall along more than two kilometres of the structure. The project remains at an early stage as FireFox and predecessor companies have drilled approximately 12,594 metres to date.FireFox's structural model identified repetitive dilatant zones along the MSZ where vein swarms and higher-grade gold are concentrated. Three main areas of gold mineralization have been identified along a 2.1-kilometre segment of the MSZ, namely the Central Zone, the Northeast Target, and the East Target.During the year 2022, FireFox completed a total of 25 diamond drill holes for 3,904 metres at Mustajarvi, testing the Northeast Target, the East Target, the Gabbro Target and the Central Zone. The final program of the year included six holes totalling 977 metres, three of those holes are reported herein.The East Target mineralization exhibits extensive albite - sericite alteration, as is typical along the MSZ, but iron oxide and iron carbonate veining are more common in this eastern part of Mustajarvi. The drill logs from the recent drilling also include increased reports of mafic volcanics interbedded with the metasediments and tuffaceous rocks that host most of the Mustajarvi mineralization. Gold continues to be closely correlated with the occurrence of pyrite. Similar to previously reported holes from the East Target, the near-surface gold mineralization from the most recent holes is associated with fractures and impregnation of (partially oxidized) pyrite along fractures, forming blebs, nests, disseminated, semi-massive and massive pyrite mineralization within the host rock. The thicker intervals reported in 22MJ021 and 22MJ022 present strong evidence of hydrothermal replacement of the host rock with quartz-sericite-pyrite  iron oxide. Pyrite can be seen to be replacing laminations and other sedimentary textures (See Figures 2 and 3).Figures 2 and 3 - Albite-quartz ( tourmaline) alteration with pyrite replacement at East Target (Click here to enlarge)The deeper mineralized intervals include the more typical quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-pyrite (QCTP) veins that are commonly seen at Mustajarvi. The vein and replacement types of mineralization may be separate events, but the geochemistry is very similar - dominated by an association with bismuth, tellurium, molybdenum, cobalt, and nickel and low in arsenic and copper. There are at least two major directions of controlling structure on the Mustajarvi mineralization, east-northeast striking (parallel to the MSZ) and north-northwest striking (perpendicular to the MSZ). There are still results pending for two holes drilled along the northwest-southeast profile at the East Target, and FireFox geologists continue to study the relationship between the narrow high-grade veins and thicker replacement style of mineralization.Hole 22MJ021 was designed to test the east-west extent of the near-surface, high grade gold mineralization identified in drill hole 22MJ006. The hole was collared approximately 28 metres west of 22MJ006 in thin glacial sediments overlying intensely altered intermediate tuffites, interbedded with mafic volcanic rocks.The 28 mineralized intervals (1 g/t gold) confirmed by the assays included both vein and replacement styles of mineralization, starting immediately below glacial till overburden at a depth of 11.0m and continuing to a depth of 94.65m (Table 1). The best interval reported above (15.5m averaging 13.09 g/t Au) appears to be contiguous with the high-grade gold reported previously in 22MJ006 and extends that mineralization approximately 15m to the west-southwest. The results from the upper portion of this drillhole (11.0 to 27.5m) have been reported from a 1,000-gram screen fire assay protocol.Hole 22MJ022 was drilled on the same profile as hole 22MJ021, approximately 40 metres to the southwest, and nearly 65 metres west of 22MJ006. Its east-plunging configuration was designed to undercut the shallow high-grade zone. It was collared in thin glacial sediments overlying intensely altered intermediate tuffites and lesser mafic sequences, and it intersected eleven intervals containing 1.0 g/t Au, starting at 20.1m downhole. The best interval started at 24.6m depth and returned 5.4m averaging 21.66 g/t Au, including 3.0 m at 37.39 g/t Au.More importantly, hole 22MJ022 also intersected deeper high-grade gold mineralization at 86m, such deeper veins have not been commonly encountered to date at the East Target. This interval returned 1.7m averaging 31.6 g/t Au, including 0.7m at 55.06 g/t Au. The deepest interval from this hole was at a depth of 90.7m and included 2.0m averaging 6.13 g/t Au.Hole 22MJ023 was drilled approximately 35 metres northwest of hole 22MJ022. The hole was collared in thin glacial sediments overlying intensely altered tuffites and metasediments. The hole intersected 8 narrow intervals that assayed above 1 g/t Au, including a deeper interval of 4.0m averaging 4.22 g/t Au starting at 89m. The highest-grade interval started at 53m and returned 1m at 26.4 g/t Au.Table 1: Significant Drill Intercepts in Drillholes 22MJ021 - 22MJ023Cut-off Grade 0.5 g/t AuDrill HoleFrom (m)To (m)Interval (m)Au Grade (g/t)Grade Thickness(gram - metres)11.026.515.513.0926614.418.03.616.4520.026.56.519.1823.026.53.524.3534.335.00.71.4036.037.01.00.6939.040.01.00.7040.042.02.09.0744.046.02.010.5145.046.01.019.4347.048.01.01.2750.051.01.01.7360.762.72.00.9865.5566.40.851.4968.069.91.91.8875.178.02.91.2680.082.22.22.8786.287.150.950.5188.1589.00.851.1193.6594.651.01.0020.121.00.91.1919122.830.07.216.4324.630.05.421.6626.229.23.037.963.464.41.02.5967.568.51.00.6374.276.01.81.0686.087.71.731.6186.887.70.955.0790.792.72.06.13101.5102.51.00.5334.335.20.90.605340.041.01.00.6645.046.01.01.0353.054.01.026.4057.058.01.05.0461.061.90.93.1689.093.04.04.2290.092.02.06.36Notes: Drilling is believed to be perpendicular to the dip of the mineralization, however interval true widths are not yet known and will be confirmed with additional drilling and geologic modelling. In this table, the aggregate grade-thickness of the entire drill hole is provided. For each interval exceeding the 0.5 g/t Au cut-off, the interval thickness is multiplied by its gold grade, and the sum of all those intervals is reported as total Grade - Thickness in \"gram - metres\" of gold. Intercept includes a total of 1.7m of core loss - one interval of 0.9 and another of 0.8m. Both intervals were near the top of the hole (above 14.4 metres downhole). These lost intervals were assigned a grade of 0.0 g/t Au for all calculations.The table below summarizes the location information for the fall 2022 drill campaign at Mustajarvi.Table 2: Collar Details for Drilling at Mustajarvi Q4 2022(coordinates presented in EPSG:3067).Drill HoleEastingNorthingAzimuth(deg)Plunge(deg)Final Depth (m)Status22MJ021429080.67501029.76040103.4Reported Here22MJ022429046.57501009.96035151.2Reported Here22MJ023429028.27501039.46040124.9Reported Here22MJ024429098.97500995.532035160.5Assays Pending22MJ025429080.07501061.014062266.7Assays Pending22MJ026428403.07500706.04050170.4Assays PendingMethodology  Quality AssuranceThe core was transported from the rig to the Company's core storage facility in Sodankyla, where FireFox's exploration team conducted the geological and geotechnical logging and selected the assay intervals. Assay intervals were generally 1 metre but in some circumstances were modified according to lithological boundaries and other factors. FireFox geologists maintained chain of custody and sampling procedures according to best industry practice and with due attention to quality assurance and quality control, including sampling field duplicates and insertion of certified standard and blank samples.FireFox team members transported the samples to an ALS sample prep lab in Sodankyla. The samples were sawed then crushed to -2 mm, split and pulverized into 1kg pulps, before being shipped to the ALS facility in Rosia Montana, Romania for gold by fire assay of 50 gm aliquots with AAS finish (method Au-AA24). Selected samples were assayed with a 1,000-gram Au-SCR24 method (screen fire assays). Other elements, altogether 48, were measured after four-acid digestion by ICP-AES and ICP-MS (method ME-MS61) at the ALS facility located in Loughrea, Ireland.ALS Laboratories is a leading international provider of assay and analytical data to the mining industry. All ALS geochemical hub laboratories, including the Irish facility, are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017 for specific analytical procedures.

As the nation's population crests and begins to shrink, experts say, it will face challenges ranging from supporting the elderly to filling the ranks of its military.Population growth has been slowing for years, but the announcement Tuesday that the country's population fell by about 850,000 in 2022 came sooner than earlier projections. \"Those developments ... may well feed domestic challenges at home and strategic challenges abroad. The Party, in short, may be in for a rough go,\" said Mike Mazza, an analyst of Chinese military modernization at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Others are less pessimistic. \"China's increasingly becoming a higher-tech nation, so concentrating on improving the educational system, particularly in impoverished rural areas, and even in cities, is vital. So as well is increasing productivity. Wealthier people will buy more, which also increases GDP,\" said June Teufel Dreyer, a Chinese politics specialist at the University of Miami.With the trend expected to continue, the U.N. estimates China's population will fall from 1.41 billion to about 1.31 billion by 2050 and keep shrinking from there. Beijing previously tried to rein in its population growth. Worries that China's population was getting too big prompted it to adopt its \"one-child policy\" in the late 1970s. Beijing says the policy prevented 400 million additional births, but demographers disagree about how much of the drop in birth rates is explained by the policy.The one-child policy came on top of existing societal changes, notably the flocking of people to live in cities during the economic boom, demographers say. \"Of course, the one-child policy had an effect,\" said Sabine Henning, who heads the demographic change section at the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok. \"But lifestyles have changed. Living expenses have increased so people are less inclined to have children. All of this has resulted ... in a further decline in fertility since the one-child policy stopped.\"Experience in Europe and Japan shows how difficult it is to change mindsets and reverse the decline with government incentives and campaigns.Faced with a crashing birthrate, the policy was abandoned seven years ago, but efforts to encourage bigger families have been largely unsuccessful, like similar efforts in other countries. Europe and Japan have also struggled to change mindsets and reverse the decline with government incentives and campaigns.\"It amazes me how everyone seems to agree that the planet already has too many people whose demands for even the basics of existence like food, water and shelter are placing intolerable demands on the ecosystem -- yet as soon as the population of a country begins to decline, its government reacts with near panic,\" Dreyer said.Beijing's most immediate demographic challenge is an aging population: Tuesday's figures showed almost 20 of the population is now age 60 or older, and Chinese estimates say the number will rise to 30, or more than 400 million people, by 2035. Similar changes took decades in Europe.\"They had more time to adjust, whereas it's happening much faster in in Asia,\" said Srinivas Tata, director of the social development division at the U.N. commission in Bangkok.To support this population of retirees, China may increase the retirement age, currently 50-55 for women and 60 for men. The demographic news comes as China's economy is still recovering from the three-year struggle against COVID-19, which not only battered the economy but sparked rare antigovernment and anti-party protest.Even with a shrinking population, China maintains considerable economic advantages over emerging manufacturing rivals such as Vietnam and India, which is set to overtake China as most populous this year. China has superior infrastructure and long-standing private sector relationships that it can rely on for years to come, said Mazza.China's political system also plays a role, said Mary Gallagher, a scholar of Chinese politics at the University of Michigan. \"Becoming the workshop of the world... requires a political system that can take advantage of that cheap young labor without much regard for the laborers' political and civil rights,\" Gallagher said.U.S. economic sanctions and its push to block Beijing's access to cutting-edge processors and chip-making technology are further complicating efforts at recovery. The Party also faces a challenge finding qualified recruits for its military, the 2 million-member People's Liberation Army, experts say. \"It is doubtful that the PLA is getting the best and the brightest, given that families who have the means will discourage military service,\" said Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute and an expert on East Asian security issues and US-China relations.Blumenthal warns, however: \"That said, if (Chinese leader Xi Jinping) decides he wants a war over Taiwan he will not be deterred by caring about one-child families.\"Some American observers argue that these challenges could prompt Beijing to make aggressive moves sooner. With the U.S. refocused on the Indo-Pacific, China's economy slowing and the population shrinking, some in Washington see Beijing as facing a narrowing window for military action against the self-governing island that it claims as its territory.Still, the effects may not be known for some time.\"Since demographic changes happen slowly, at least at the start of the turn, their effect on China's standing and influence globally will take time to happen,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the London University School of Oriental and African Studies and a longtime observer of Chinese political and social trends.President Xi is committed to his program of achieving \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" by 2049, Tsang said -- even if his country may be 100 million people smaller by then.", "normalized_body": "beij ap seven decad china comunist parti rule world popul countri nation popul crest begin shrink expert say wil face chaleng rang suport elderli file rank militarypopul growth ben slow year anounc tuesday countri popul fel came soner earlier project develop may wel fed domest chaleng home strateg chaleng abroad parti short may rough go said mike maza analyst chine militari modern american enterpris institut washington other le pesimist china increasingli becom highertech nation concentr improv educ system particularli impoverish rural area even citi vital wel increas product wealthier peopl wil buy also increas gdp said june teufel dreyer chine polit specialist univers miamiwith trend expect continu un estim china popul wil fal bilion bilion kep shrink beij previous tri rein popul growth wori china popul gete big prompt adopt onechild polici late 0 beij say polici prevent milion adit birth demograph disagr much drop birth rate explain policyth onechild polici came top exist societ chang notabl flock peopl live citi econom bom demograph say cours onechild polici efect said sabin hene head demograph chang section un econom social comis asia pacif bangkok lifestyl chang live expens increas peopl le inclin child al result declin fertil sinc onechild polici stope experi europ japan show dificult chang mindset revers declin govern incent campaignsfac crash birthrat polici abandon seven year ago efort encourag biger famili ben larg unsuces like similar efort countri europ japan also strugl chang mindset revers declin govern incent campaign amaz everyon sem agr planet alreadi mani peopl whose demand even basic exist like fod water shelter place intoler demand ecosystem yet son popul countri begin declin govern react near panic dreyer saidbeij imedi demograph chaleng age popul tuesday figur show almost popul age older chine estim say number wil rise milion peopl similar chang tok decad europ time adjust wherea hapen much faster asia said sriniva tata director social develop divis un comis bangkokto suport popul retir china may increas retir age curent woman men demograph news come china economi stil recov threyear strugl covid0 bater economi spark rare antigovern antiparti protesteven shrink popul china maintain consider econom advantag emerg manufactur rival vietnam india set overtak china popul year china superior infrastructur longstand privat sector relationship reli year come said mazachina polit system also play role said mari galagh scholar chine polit univers michigan becom workshop world requir polit system take advantag cheap young labor without much regard labor polit civil right galagh saidu econom sanction push block beij ace cutingedg procesor chipmak technolog complic efort recoveri parti also face chaleng find qualifi recruit militari milionmemb peopl liber armi expert say doubt pla gete best brightest given famili mean wil discourag militari servic said daniel blumenth director asian studi american enterpris institut expert east asian secur isu uschina relationsblumenth warn howev said chine leader xi jinp decid want war taiwan wil deter care onechild famili american observ argu chaleng could prompt beij make agres move soner u refocus indopacif china economi slow popul shrink washington se beij face narow window militari action selfgovern island claim teritorystil efect may known time sinc demograph chang hapen slowli least start turn efect china stand influenc globali wil take time hapen said steve tsang director china institut london univers schol orient african studi longtim observ chine polit social trendspresid xi comit program achiev great rejuven chine nation tsang said even countri may milion peopl smaler"}

Inflation peaked at a 41-year high of 11.1 in October.While the drop is welcome, inflation is still running at levels last seen in the early 1980s. U.K. prices are also rising faster than in other major industrialized nations. Inflation slowed to 6.5 last month in the U.S. and 9.2 in the 20 countries that use the euro.Inflation soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine fueled sharp increases in food and energy prices, eroding savings and living standards. That has triggered a wave of strikes across Britain as nurses, train drivers, border guards and teachers demand pay increases and the government tries to prevent higher wages from triggering a second round of domestically driven inflation that could be more difficult to reverse.\"High inflation is a nightmare for family budgets, destroys business investment and leads to strike action, so however tough, we need to stick to our plan to bring it down,'' U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said. \"While any fall in inflation is welcome, we have a plan to go further and halve inflation this year, reduce debt and grow the economy -- but it is vital that we take the difficult decisions needed and see the plan through.''The inflation rate fell in December as the price of motor vehicle fuels rose more slowly than in previous months. The cost of gasoline and diesel increased 11.5 in the 12 months through December, down from 17.2 the previous month. But that gave little relief to beleaguered British consumers, who saw food price inflation accelerate for a 17th consecutive month. Food costs soared 16.9 in December, compared with 16.5 in November.The price of eating out also rose, with costs for visiting a restaurant or hotel jumping 11.4 in December, up from 10.2 in November. Inflation is expected to slow in the coming months as last year's surge in energy prices begins to drop out of the annual inflation figures. Consumers are also being helped by a mild winter in Europe, which has reduced demand for heating oil and natural gas and cut prices. Wholesale natural gas prices, which soared tenfold during the first six months of the war in Ukraine, have fallen more than 60 from their August peak.With inflation beginning to moderate, attention is now shifting to how quickly it will return to the Bank of England's 2 target.Economists are particularly focused on the cost of services such as hotels and restaurants, as businesses pass on higher costs to consumers.Deutsche Bank expects the U.K. inflation rate to drop by 50 this year and reach the central bank's target around the middle of 2024. \"But inflation persistence will, we think, be the key theme for the year as central banks across the world tilt their focus more fully to core inflation, and in particular services prices,\" the bank said before the December inflation figure was released.", "normalized_body": "london ap uk inflat ea second month decemb bost confid costofliv crisi peakedconsum price rose year decemb previou month ofic nation statist said wednesday inflat peak 0year high octoberwhil drop welcom inflat stil rune level last sen earli 0 uk price also rise faster major industri nation inflat slow last month u countri use euroinfl soar rusia invas ukrain fuel sharp increas fod energi price erod save live standard triger wave strike acro britain nurs train driver border guard teacher demand pay increas govern tri prevent higher wage triger second round domesticali driven inflat could dificult revers high inflat nightmar famili budget destroy busin invest lead strike action howev tough ned stick plan bring uk treasuri chief jeremi hunt said fal inflat welcom plan go halv inflat year reduc debt grow economi vital take dificult decis nede se plan inflat rate fel decemb price motor vehicl fuel rose slowli previou month cost gasolin diesel increas month decemb previou month gave litl relief beleagu british consum saw fod price inflat aceler 0th consecut month fod cost soar decemb compar novemberth price eat also rose cost visit restaur hotel jump decemb novemb inflat expect slow come month last year surg energi price begin drop anual inflat figur consum also help mild winter europ reduc demand heat oil natur ga cut price wholesal natur ga price soar tenfold first six month war ukrain falen august peakwith inflat begin moder atent shift quickli wil return bank england targeteconomist particularli focus cost servic hotel restaur busines pa higher cost consumersdeutsch bank expect uk inflat rate drop year reach central bank target around midl inflat persist wil think key theme year central bank acro world tilt focu fuli core inflat particular servic price bank said decemb inflat figur releas"}

During 90 minutes in the courtroom, liberal and conservative justices suggested they were inclined to rule for the student, Miguel Luna Perez.His lawyer, Roman Martinez, said that for 12 years, the public school system in Sturgis, Michigan, \"neglected Miguel, denied him an education and lied to his parents about the progress he was allegedly making in school.\"\"This shameful conduct permanently stunted Miguel's ability to communicate with the outside world,\" Martinez said.Justice Elena Kagan indicated that she believed the argument that Perez had done \"everything right\" in pursuing his case.\"It's hard for me to see how that's not true. What should Miguel have done differently from what he did do in this case?\" Kagan said. The liberal justice suggested to a lawyer for the school system, Shay Dvoretzky, that such cases are pursued \"by parents who are trying to do right by their kids.\"Perez, now 27, was in the courtroom. He watched with the assistance of American Sign Language translators and Certified Deaf Interpreters, who can help when a person's communication skills are limited.It remains difficult for Perez, who emigrated to the United States from Mexico at age 9, to make himself understood. Perez's lawyers say the school system failed him by not providing a qualified sign language interpreter. An aide who helped him did not know ASL but tried to teach herself so-called Signed English from a book. She essentially invented a system of signing only she and Perez understood, leaving him unable to communicate with others, his lawyers said.The school system also mislead his parents into believing he was on track to earn his high school diploma. Just before graduation, however, his family was told he qualified only for a \"certificate of completion,\" not a diploma.His family responded by pursuing claims under two laws: the broad Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against disabled people, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The latter guarantees children with disabilities a free public education that is tailored to their specific needs.Perez's family and the school district ultimately settled the IDEA claims. The district agreed to pay for extra schooling and sign language instruction for Perez and his family, among other things. The family then went to federal court and, under the ADA, sought monetary damages, which are not available under the IDEA.Lower courts said the settlement barred Perez from pursuing his ADA claims in federal court. Perez's lawyers said the 2-1 decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, written by Judge Amul Thapar, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was out of line with every other federal appeals court that has considered the issue.Former federal education officials were among those who told the Supreme Court in written briefs that the appeals court's decision was wrong. The officials said upholding the lower court decisions would hurt children with disabilities by forcing them to choose between immediately getting issues resolved but forfeiting other claims or delaying to try to get fuller relief.While the IDEA encourages settlements, upholding the lower court decision would force students and their families to \"forgo speedy relief and waste time, money and administrative resources\" to preserve their other claims, they said. The Biden administration also urged the court to side with Perez.Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was among the justices who seemed inclined to agree with Perez. The liberal justice said it was her understanding that \"Congress thought that dual actions at least in some circumstances were possible and that was fine.\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, noted that rejecting an IDEA settlement offer means risking not being able to seek attorneys fees. Her fellow conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch, suggested that the text of the IDEA also supports Perez.A national school board association and an association of school superintendents were among those who told the court in written briefs that lower courts were right. They said ruling otherwise would weaken the IDEA's collaborative process to resolve issues and lead to more lengthy and expensive court proceedings.Perez graduated from the Michigan School for the Deaf in June 2020 with a diploma. He said in a written statement provided with the assistance of an interpreter and a translator that he learned building skills at the school and wants to build houses as a job. His case at the Supreme Court is hard for him to understand, he said, though he understands part of it is \"about having no interpreter.\"\"I wish I could have gone to college,\" he said. \"I don't have a job, but I want to have one. I want to make my own choices.\"A decision in his case, Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools, 21-887, is expected by the end of June.___Follow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court", "normalized_body": "washington ap suprem court wednesday seme sympathet argument deaf student su public schol system provid inadequ educ legal chaleng import disabl student familiesth question justic involv feder law guarant disabl student educ specif ned minut courtrom liber conserv justic sugest inclin rule student miguel luna perezhi lawyer roman martinez said year public schol system sturgi michigan neglect miguel deni educ lie parent progr alegedli make schol shame conduct perman stunt miguel abil comun outsid world martinez saidjustic elena kagan indic believ argument perez done everyth right pursu case hard se that true miguel done difer case kagan said liber justic sugest lawyer schol system shay dvoretzki case pursu parent tri right kid perez courtrom watch asist american sign languag translat certifi deaf interpret help person comun skil limitedit remain dificult perez emigr unit state mexico age make understod perez lawyer say schol system fail provid qualifi sign languag interpret aid help know asl tri teach socal sign english bok esentiali invent system sign perez understod leav unabl comun other lawyer saidth schol system also mislead parent believ track earn high schol diploma graduat howev famili told qualifi certif complet diplomahi famili respond pursu claim two law broad american disabl act prohibit discrimin disabl peopl individu disabl educ act later guarant child disabl fre public educ tailor specif nedsperez famili schol district ultim setl idea claim district agr pay extra schole sign languag instruct perez famili among thing famili went feder court ada sought monetari damag avail idealow court said setlement bare perez pursu ada claim feder court perez lawyer said decis 0th u circuit court apeal writen judg amul thapar apoint former presid donald trump line everi feder apeal court consid isueform feder educ ofici among told suprem court writen brief apeal court decis wrong ofici said uphold lower court decis would hurt child disabl forc chose betwen imedi gete isu resolv forfeit claim delay tri get fuler reliefwhil idea encourag setlement uphold lower court decis would forc student famili forgo spedi relief wast time money administr resourc preserv claim said biden administr also urg court side perezjustic ketanji brown jackson among justic seme inclin agr perez liber justic said understand congr thought dual action least circumst posibl fine justic ami coney baret conserv note reject idea setlement ofer mean risk abl sek atorney fe felow conserv justic neil gorsuch sugest text idea also suport pereza nation schol board asoci asoci schol superintend among told court writen brief lower court right said rule otherwis would weaken idea colabor proce resolv isu lead lengthi expens court procedingsperez graduat michigan schol deaf june diploma said writen statement provid asist interpret translat learn build skil schol want build hous job case suprem court hard understand said though understand part interpret wish could gone coleg said dont job want one want make choic decis case perez sturgi public schol expect end junefolow ap coverag u suprem court"}

(AP) -- A suspect wanted in connection with a fatal shooting at the Mall of America in December was arrested in Georgia on Tuesday, police said.Bloomington, Minnesota, Police Chief Booker Hodges said during a news conference Tuesday that the 17-year-old suspect was taken into custody in Decatur, Georgia, by federal and state law enforcement officials. The suspect faces charges of second-degree murder and second-degree assault. The Associated Press typically does not name juvenile criminal defendants.Johntae Hudson, 19, was killed in a Dec. 23 shooting at the Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping center located in Bloomington.Hudson was shot eight times and died during an altercation inside the mall's Nordstrom store. Witnesses, mall security guards and first responders tried to save him. Customers scrambled for safety and the nation's largest shopping center went into lockdown on one of the final days of the holiday shopping season. The suspect arrested Tuesday in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb, was one of four suspects charged by Minnesota prosecutors in December. They include two other 17-year-olds and 18-year-old Taeshawn Adams Wright. Wright faces counts of second-degree murder and second-degree assault. The two 17-year-olds have been charged with second-degree riot while armed with a dangerous weapon.Hodges said police on Tuesday also arrested the teenage suspect's mother in Golden Valley, Minnesota. She was charged with aiding and abetting the suspect for allegedly driving him to Georgia following the shooting.The suspect remains in custody in Georgia pending extradition to Minnesota.

The Israeli military arrested Stefania Costantini during a pre-dawn incursion Monday into the the Dheisha refugee camp in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Footage shared on social media shows an Israeli soldier picking up Costantini and flipping her over his shoulders as she shrieks. A group of soldiers drag her out of the camp and shove her into a military vehicle, videos show. Israeli forces fatally shot a 14-year-old boy in the head during the same raid as they opened fire on Palestinians throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. Italian media described Costantini as an advocate for Palestinian rights. Israel's Shin Bet security service said Costantini was arrested on suspicion of belonging to, and transferring funds to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The militant group, known as the PFLP, was involved in hijacking passenger planes in the 1960s and 1970s and later claimed responsibility for suicide attacks during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s. It is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.The Shin Bet said Costantini arrived in Israel on May 2 last year on a tourist visa and was summoned for interrogation last September about her alleged involvement with the PFLP. Costantini did not report to authorities \"and even continued her activities\" for the militant group, the security agency said. Israel deported her on Monday afternoon, the Interior Ministry said.The COBAS leftist labor union in Pisa, Italy, to which Costantini belongs, expressed \"consternation\" at the news of her arrest and deportation. The union said it was concerned for Costantini's \"health and safety.\" The group described Costantini as a specialist working with students with disabilities who has long sought to defend \"those whose rights are denied.\" Several months ago, the group said, Costantini left her life in Italy and moved to a Palestinian refugee camp. It made no mention of the Israeli security agency's allegations.The Italian consulate in Jerusalem did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli and Italian foreign ministries also did not comment.But on Monday, the day of Costantini's deportation, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen wrote on Twitter that he held a phone conversation with his Italian counterpart. The readout of the call focused on the countries' joint efforts to \"fight terrorism\" and boost their \"political cooperation.\" It made no mention of Costantini's case. Israel has stepped up its fight in recent years against Palestinian activists and rights groups. Last summer, the Israeli military raided and shuttered the offices of Palestinian human rights organizations that it designated as terrorist groups over their alleged links to the PFLP. Nine European countries rejected Israel's charges against the rights groups, citing a lack of evidence.___Associated Press writer Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.

Its rival, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League party, criticized the move, saying it meant to deepen the political crisis and force early parliamentary elections.As opposition leader, Khan has been campaigning for early elections and has claimed -- without providing evidence -- that his ouster last April in a no-confidence vote in Parliament was illegal. He has also accused his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, the Pakistani military and the United States of orchestrating his ouster. Sharif, army officials and Washington have all dismissed the allegations. Khan has also banked on his popularity and wide grassroot support to force early elections, and has since his ouster staged rallies across the country, calling for the vote. But Sharif and his Pakistan Muslim League have repeatedly dismissed the demands, saying elections will be held as scheduled -- later in 2023 -- when the current parliament completes its five-year term. On Wednesday, Ghulam Ali, provincial governor in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, dissolved the local assembly there, just days after another Khan ally, provincial lawmaker Pervez Elahi, dissolved the assembly in Punjab, the country's most populous province, in eastern Pakistan. Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party was in power in both provinces. The dissolution of the chambers will lead to snap elections in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab -- and may lead to the party being reelected in both provinces -- but will unlikely effect any change on the national level.Sharif's government maintains that the tactics of the 70-year-old Khan are damaging the country's economy. Pakistan has struggled with the aftermath of unprecedented floods that devastated the country last summer and which experts say were exacerbated by climate change. Cash-strapped Pakistan is also facing a serious financial crisis and unabating militant violence.Khan, a former cricket star turned Islamist politician, was wounded in a gun attack while leading a rally toward the capital, Islamabad, last November. One of Khan's supporters was killed and several others were wounded in the shooting. Khan accused Sharif's government of being behind the attack; authorities have denied the allegation. The gunman was arrested on the scene. Since the assassination attempt, Khan has been leading his political campaign from his hometown of Lahore, the capital of Punjab. Also on Wednesday, suspected militants ambushed a security convoy in a remote area in southwestern Pakistan, near the Iranian border, killing four soldiers, the military said. The army statement said the attackers used Iran's territory to launch the attack and that Islamabad has asked Tehran to arrest the assailants.", "normalized_body": "peshawar pakistan ap parti pakistan former prime minist imran khan wednesday disolv provinci asembl countri northwest held major seat rival rule pakistan muslim leagu parti critic move say meant depen polit crisi forc earli parliamentari electionsa oposit leader khan ben campaign earli elect claim without provid evid ouster last april noconfid vote parliament ileg also acus sucesor prime minist shahbaz sharif pakistani militari unit state orchestr ouster sharif armi ofici washington al dismis aleg khan also bank popular wide grasrot suport forc earli elect sinc ouster stage rali acro countri cale vote sharif pakistan muslim leagu repeatedli dismis demand say elect wil held schedul later curent parliament complet fiveyear term wednesday ghulam ali provinci governor northwestern khyber pakhtunkhwa provinc disolv local asembl day anoth khan ali provinci lawmak pervez elahi disolv asembl punjab countri popul provinc eastern pakistan khan tehrekeinsaf parti power provinc disolut chamber wil lead snap elect khyber pakhtunkhwa punjab may lead parti relect provinc wil unlik efect chang nation levelsharif govern maintain tactic 0yearold khan damag countri economi pakistan strugl aftermath unpreced flod devast countri last sumer expert say exacerb climat chang cashstrap pakistan also face seriou financi crisi unab milit violencekhan former cricket star turn islamist politician wound gun atack lead rali toward capit islamabad last novemb one khan suport kile sever other wound shote khan acus sharif govern behind atack author deni aleg gunman arest scene sinc asasin atempt khan ben lead polit campaign hometown lahor capit punjab also wednesday suspect milit ambush secur convoy remot area southwestern pakistan near iranian border kile four soldier militari said armi statement said atack use iran teritori launch atack islamabad ask tehran arest asail"}

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is launching investigations this month into select nursing homes, aimed at verifying whether patients have been properly diagnosed with the psychiatric disorder.Evidence has mounted over decades that some facilities wrongly diagnose residents with schizophrenia or administer antipsychotic drugs to sedate them, despite dangerous side effects that could include death, according to the agency.\"No nursing home resident should be improperly diagnosed with schizophrenia or given an inappropriate antipsychotic,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Wednesday. \"The steps we are taking today will help prevent these errors and give families peace of mind.\"Some facilities may be dodging increased scrutiny around gratuitous use of antipsychotic medications by coding residents as having schizophrenia, even when they do not show signs of the extremely rare disorder, a government report last year found. Less than 1 of the population is believed to have schizophrenia, which is marked by delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking. In 2012, the federal government began tracking when nursing homes use antipsychotics on residents -- doing so can impact the facility's quality rating in a public database -- but only for those who have not been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Antipsychotics for those nursing home residents has dropped to under 20 in recent years, according to federal data. A November report from the HHS Office of the Inspector General, however, revealed that the number of residents reported as having schizophrenia without a corresponding diagnosis skyrocketed between 2015 and 2019, with 99 nursing homes in the country reporting that 20 or more of their residents have the disorder. \"The number of unsupported schizophrenia diagnoses increased and in 2019 was concentrated in relatively few nursing homes,\" the report concluded. Nursing homes have worked on other ways to treat residents, especially those with dementia, and trained staff to use alternative methods, said Katie Smith Sloan, the CEO of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit aging service providers.\"Much has been achieved since the program's start in 2012, and nursing homes deserve a lot of the credit for the progress,\" she said in a statement.CMS will start targeted audits to ask nursing homes for documentation of the diagnoses in the coming days, focusing on nursing homes with existing residents who have been recorded as having schizophrenia. The rating scores for nursing homes that have a pattern of inaccurately coding residents as having schizophrenia will be negatively impacted, CMS said in a statement released Wednesday, stopping short of threatening to levy fines against facilities. Dinging nursing homes' public ratings will be effective in some cases, said Dr. Shekinah Fashaw-Walters, a researcher at the University of Minnesota who has found that schizophrenia diagnoses have risen in Black nursing home patients compared with their white counterparts in recent years.She is hopeful that the CMS audits will help to narrow that racial disparity and said that it's \"about time\" for CMS' plan.\"It's time to do this and really hold nursing homes accountable for providing high quality care,\" she said. \"I'm thrilled to see that they are taking these steps, and I think they're very warranted.\"The agency does not have plans to immediately intervene in the patients' care directly or notify relatives of residents who have been wrongly coded or given antipsychotics, according to senior HHS officials who insisted on anonymity to brief The Associated Press on the matter on Tuesday.CMS will monitor the facilities to make sure the issues are corrected, officials said.", "normalized_body": "washington ap feder govern say wil begin target crackdown nurs home abus antipsychot drug misdiagnos schizophrenia patient center medicar medicaid servic launch investig month select nurs home aim verifi whether patient ben properli diagnos psychiatr disorderevid mount decad facil wrongli diagnos resid schizophrenia administ antipsychot drug sedat despit danger side efect could includ death acord agenc nurs home resid improperli diagnos schizophrenia given inapropri antipsychot health human servic secretari xavier becera said statement wednesday step take today wil help prevent eror give famili peac mind facil may dodg increas scrutini around gratuit use antipsychot medic code resid schizophrenia even show sign extrem rare disord govern report last year found le popul believ schizophrenia mark delus halucin disord think feder govern began track nurs home use antipsychot resid impact facil qualiti rate public databas ben diagnos schizophrenia antipsychot nurs home resid drope recent year acord feder data novemb report h ofic inspector gener howev reveal number resid report schizophrenia without corespond diagnosi skyrocket betwen nurs home countri report resid disord number unsuport schizophrenia diagnos increas concentr rel nurs home report conclud nurs home work way treat resid especiali dementia train staf use altern method said kati smith sloan ceo leadingag asoci nonprofit age servic provid much ben achiev sinc program start nurs home deserv lot credit progr said statementcm wil start target audit ask nurs home document diagnos come day focus nurs home exist resid ben record schizophrenia rate score nurs home patern inacur code resid schizophrenia wil neg impact cm said statement releas wednesday stope short threaten levi fine facil ding nurs home public rate wil efect case said dr shekinah fashawwalt research univers minesota found schizophrenia diagnos risen black nurs home patient compar white counterpart recent yearssh hope cm audit wil help narow racial dispar said time cm plan time reali hold nurs home acount provid high qualiti care said im thrile se take step think theyr warant agenc plan imedi interven patient care directli notifi rel resid ben wrongli code given antipsychot acord senior h ofici insist anonym brief asoci pre mater tuesdaycm wil monitor facil make sure isu corect ofici said"}

Jack Campbell made 29 saves.\"We are happier with the way we are playing, I think that is the key thing,\" said Hyman, who has a career-high 29 assists. \"We are playing the right way. We are playing strong, mature third periods. That is the key, playing to our game and making sure we make it difficult on the other guys on the other side, and understanding the type of game you are in when you are up. I think that is really encouraging.\"McDavid leads the NHL with 38 goals. He extended his point streak to eight games and has at least one point in 25 of his last 26 games.Daniel Sprong and Vince Dunn each had a goal for the Kraken (26-14-4), who have lost two in a row following an eight-game winning streak. \"We talked before the game -- it's a big one. We needed those two points. So it's really disappointing not to get a result,\" Dunn said. \"We had a good run, we let two games slide. We have to go back home and get back to work.\"Seattle took a 1-0 lead 3:11 into the opening period on the power play as Sprong's shot hit a defender and deflected past Campbell, who was making his fourth straight start. It was Sprong's 15th of the season.Edmonton tied it with 5:52 to play in the first as McDavid went coast-to-coast, taking on four defenders and dancing past a couple of them before taking a shot from his off foot that picked the top corner past goalie Martin Jones.The Oilers moved in front 3:15 into the second when a shot by rookie Vincent Desharnais snuck under Jones and was just sitting there before Ryan swooped in to guide in his sixth of the season.Edmonton took a two-goal lead 12:30 into the second during a mad scramble in front as the puck came loose to Foegele, who sent a backhand into the net despite the fact he was sitting on the ice at the time.There were a couple of bizarre goals to start the third.Just 22 seconds in, Dunn unleashed a long shot that Campbell would love to have back as he flubbed it and it tipped off his glove and in.The Oilers responded 61 seconds later, however, as Eeli Tolvanen poke-checked a puck away from Hyman, but straight into his own net past a surprised Jones. Hyman was credited with his 21st goal.Edmonton made it 5-2 midway through the third as Dylan Holloway hit a post and the puck popped straight to McLeod at the side of the net for the easy tap-in.

(AP) -- Nick Schmaltz and Nick Bjugstad scored on Arizona's first two shootout attempts and the Coyotes beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-3 on Tuesday night to end a nine-game losing streak.Bjugstad, Travis Boyd and Dylan Guenther scored in regulation for the Coyotes. Lawson Crouse had three assists, and Connor Ingram made 37 saves. The Coyotes fell behind 3-1 early in the third period before Boyd and Guenther scored 1:10 apart to force overtime.\"We're going to play a full 60 minutes no matter what is going on,\" Boyd said. \"It's an identity of our team. We might not go out there and out-skill a team every night, but that's no excuse for not being able to work harder than the other team. To be more resilient. To fight through. We go down 3-1, we could have packed it early. \"I think we've been playing better than some of the results that we've been getting the last week or so.\" Ingram has started two straight games for the first time this season. He stopped 25 shots in a 2-1 loss Saturday in Minnesota.\"It's a learning curve for a young goalie who has always been No. 1,\" Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. \"You play two, three times a week. You have a rhythm. When you are a backup goalie and you play a bad game, you need to live with for 10 days, two weeks. It's tough mentally. Now he has a chance to play a little bit more because we play more games, and that's helps him to get going and be in a more regular situation.\"Dylan Larkin scored his team-leading 15th goal for Detroit. Pius Suter and David Perron also scored for the Red Wings in the second game of a back-to-back. They have lost six of eight.\"Loved their effort,\" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. \"Probably got a little bit in the third there, which is perfectly understandable in a back-to-back. Ran into a really good goalie tonight. A little unfortunate witn not being able to finish, but the way we played tonight, three goals on the road should be enough.\"The Coyotes had only eight goals in their previous six games before breaking out in the third period. They scored the final three goals of the game while playing their third straight one-goal game.After a sluggish first two periods, each team scored twice in a 3:03 span early in the third. Suter and Perron scored 58 seconds apart to give the Red Wings a 3-1 lead, and Boyd and Guenther countered in the 1:10 span to tie it.Guenther scored into an open side at 7:53 after Crouse's shot from the left circle hit the post and caromed to him.Magnus Hellberg made 20 saves for the Red Wings in his first start in five games. Hellstrom stopped Guenther's point-blank shot 3:32 of the third period, the best scoring chance for either team before overtime.\"I'm really disappointed right now,\" Hellberg said. \"Obviously, when you have the lead 3-1 of course you want to keep them out and win the game in regulation.\"NOTESRed Wings D Robert Hagg (undisclosed) was scratched for a second straight game after being activated Monday. Injuries have limited him to one appearance in the last 28 games. ...

The Nuggets improved to 13-0 this season when the two-time reigning NBA MVP records a triple-double.\"We're going in the right direction,\" Jokic said. \"We're playing with a lot of confidence.\" The Nuggets were without head coach Michael Malone, who missed the game after entering the league's health and safety protocols. Acting coach David Adelman stepped in and the Western Conference-leading Nuggets didn't miss a beat. In the locker room after the game, the team dumped a bucket of cold water on Adelman to celebrate.\"It was cold. No, it was cool,\" cracked Adelman, who's the son of longtime NBA coach Rick Adelman. \"The guys were excited.\"This was a game that, at times, turned into the Jokic vs. Lillard Show. It was Lillard's 214th career game with 30 or more points. But Jokic proved too difficult to contain.\"You call plays for him and those plays sometimes turn into team-conceptual basketball because of him. He gets guys involved,\" Adelman explained.Michael Porter Jr. had 23 points and Jamal Murray added 17 for Denver, which improved to 20-3 at home as a capacity crowd braved a snowstorm that was starting to hit the city. The Trail Blazers dropped their eighth straight road game. Denver led by 13 points in the fourth quarter but saw the Blazers slice into the lead. A Bruce Brown dunk helped spark another run by the Nuggets to pull away. After the game, Lillard voiced his frustration with the officiating late in the game.\"It's a lot of stuff that we could have done better, but down the stretch I just felt like the refs just decided the game,\" said Lillard, who drew a technical foul late in the fourth quarter. \"Obviously it's going to be bumps, it's going to be a physical game, both teams working hard to win a game. We get down the stretch and it was just like everything we did was a foul. That's just what it seemed like to me.\" This time, there was no need for any late-game theatrics by Jokic, who hit a last-second, game-winning 3-pointer against Orlando on Sunday.Lillard had a big first half with 30 points. He's no stranger to turning in an explosive half against Denver. He had 32 points in the second half against the Nuggets on Dec. 8. \"He's an all-time, all-time player,\" Adelman said of Lillard. \"He's something.\"TIP-INSBlazers: F Jerami Grant had 18 points, while C Jusuf Nurkic grabbed 10 rebounds. ... Lillard was 14 of 14 from the free throw line.Nuggets: F Aaron Gordon had 11 points. ... Denver closed out the season series against Portland with a 3-1 mark. ... It was Jokic's 89th career triple-double.CHAUNCEY BILLUPS COURTWhile in town, Denver native and Blazers coach Chauncey Billups attended a pep rally at his old high school, George Washington, where the basketball court was named in his honor. His daughter accompanied him to the event. \"I have some great memories obviously there,\" Billups said. \"It's where it all started. It's where I decided that I was going to take this basketball thing very, very serious and see where it took me. It was fun to go back over there -- see the court, see it named after me, the logo on the court. It was cool.\"UP NEXTBlazers: Start a six-game homestand Thursday against Philadelphia.

(AP) -- Wake Forest ended No. 19 Clemson's unexpected perfect start in Atlantic Coast Conference play in a style that demands the Demon Deacons start getting more attention of their own.Tyree Appleby scored 24 points to help Wake Forest beat Clemson 87-77 on Tuesday night, giving the Demon Deacons their fourth straight win while playing from in front nearly all night against a team that had won its first seven league games.\"As a team, we expect to win every time we step out on the floor and we do the right things,\" said Cameron Hildreth, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Wake Foerst. Generally speaking, the Demon Deacons (14-5, 6-2 ACC) did that. They went to work aggressively in the paint and knocked down their open looks from behind the arc early on, and got to the foul line the entire way. The combination had them controlling play all night and kept the Tigers in catch-up mode, while their defense even came through late when their offense sputtered a bit.\"We don't always play smart, but we play hard and we play together,\" coach Steve Forbes said. \"We share that ball. And you know, this was a game we needed to play that way. We couldn't have won this game in November, December.\"Andrew Carr had 18 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks for Wake Forest, which jumped to a double-digit lead by midway through the first half and had a quick start out of the break to push that margin to 15 points.\"I thought our guys were just a little bit behind the play in the first half especially,\" Clemson coach Brad Brownell said. \"It took us a while to to get into the game. I don't know if we had a little bit of heavy legs. And obviously some of it just Wake Forest playing so well quickly.\"The Tigers (15-4, 7-1) twice got as close as six in the second half, the last time coming on Hunter Tyson's putback dunk while drawing a foul for a three-point play with 2:07 left. But with the shot clock winding down on the ensuing possession, Hildreth took a kickout feed from Daivien Williamson and coolly knocked down a straightaway 3 for the 80-71 lead that kept Wake Forest in control.\"We didn't try to guard them as a team very well,,\" Brownell said. \"And we didn't have much success guarding them at all.\"PJ Hall had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Clemson, while Tyson had 19 points and 14 boards. The Tigers shot 42 while playing without second-leading scorer Chase Hunter due to an ankle injury. The Tigers also managed just two field goals over roughly 9 1/2 minutes during a critical stretch as the game pushed into its final stage with Wake Forest tenuously protecting its lead. Wake Forest shot 46, made nine 3-pointers and got to the foul line 33 times (making 22) while Clemson attempted just 14 free throws.BIG PICTUREClemson: Along with that first-ever 7-0 start, the Tigers had set a program record with 11 straight regular-season wins in league play. And the weekend home win against then-ranked Duke was enough to push the Tigers in Monday's latest AP Top 25 poll for the first time this season. But the Tigers led this one for only 29 seconds after Brevin Galloway's layup off the opening tip. Wake Forest: Forbes has the Demon Deacons making serious gains in Year 3. This marked the third straight win by double-digit margins for a team that already has a win against Duke and at Wisconsin on its resume. That has the Demon Deacons positioning themselves to be in the mix for the NCAA Tournament bid that barely eluded them last year -- and it also attracted an energized home crowd for this one to provide a jolt after years of spotty showings during the program's long-term struggles.UP NEXTClemson: Home against Virginia Tech on Saturday.Wake Forest: Home against No. 10 Virginia on Saturday.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap ___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "normalized_body": "winstonsalem nc ap wake forest end clemson unexpect perfect start atlant coast confer play style demand demon deacon start gete atent owntyr aplebi score point help wake forest beat clemson tuesday night give demon deacon fourth straight win play front nearli al night team first seven leagu game team expect win everi time step flor right thing said cameron hildreth point rebound wake foerst generali speak demon deacon ac went work agres paint knock open lok behind arc earli got foul line entir way combin control play al night kept tiger catchup mode defens even came late ofens sputer bit dont alway play smart play hard play togeth coach steve forb said share bal know game nede play way couldnt game novemb decemb andrew car point rebound thre block wake forest jump doubledigit lead midway first half quick start break push margin point thought guy litl bit behind play first half especiali clemson coach brad brownel said tok u get game dont know litl bit heavi leg obvious wake forest play wel quickli tiger twice got close six second half last time come hunter tyson putback dunk draw foul threpoint play left shot clock wind ensu pose hildreth tok kickout fed daivien wiliamson coli knock straightaway lead kept wake forest control didnt tri guard team wel brownel said didnt much suce guard al pj hal point nine rebound lead clemson tyson point board tiger shot play without secondlead scorer chase hunter due ankl injuri tiger also manag two field goal roughli minut critic stretch game push final stage wake forest tenuous protect lead wake forest shot made nine 0pointer got foul line time make clemson atempt fre throwsbig pictureclemson along firstev start tiger set program record straight regularseason win leagu play wekend home win thenrank duke enough push tiger monday latest ap top pol first time season tiger led one second brevin galoway layup open tip wake forest forb demon deacon make seriou gain year mark third straight win doubledigit margin team alreadi win duke wisconsin resum demon deacon posit mix nca tournament bid bare elud last year also atract energ home crowd one provid jolt year spoti show program longterm struglesup nextclemson home virginia tech saturdaywak forest home virginia saturdayfolow aaron beard twiter ap coleg basketb"}

After a scoreless first half, Swanson scored on a header off a cross from Trinity Rodman in the 52nd minute before Alex Morgan added a second goal in the 60th. Swanson's second goal came some three minutes later and Lynn Williams had another in the 74th. Formerly Mallory Pugh, Swanson took Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson's last name when the pair married in December.\"I think that ultimately I just want to be a positive impact on this team and my job is to score goals and try and set people up to score goals,\" Swanson said. \"I think that just going over my performance from the past couple of months and kind of reviewing it this offseason, there were some easy chances in games previous I should have put away.\" The match at Sky Stadium was the first of two games between the teams. Both are preparing for this summer's World Cup hosted by Australia and New Zealand. The crowd was announced at 12,508, a record for the Ferns. The second game is set for Saturday at Eden Park in Auckland. The games are the first for the Americans in the island nation. The teams have met 20 times overall, with the United States dominating the series 18-1-1. New Zealand is captained by Ali Riley, who plays for Angel City in the National Women's Soccer League. The Americans had an uncharacteristically shaky end to 2022, with losses in three of their last four games. And they got off to a slow start against the Ferns. Lindsey Horan was wide open in front of the net for a shot in the 18th that was stopped by sliding New Zealand goalkeeper Erin Naylor. Midge Purce's shot from distance in the 28th caromed off the far post. Soon after her second goal, Swanson was subbed off for Williams, who hadn't played for the national team for 11 months because of a hamstring injury that required surgery. \"It feels amazing, but I give it to my teammates. They've been there with me through the whole way, and supporting me and being like You got this Lynn.' And so it feels incredible,\" Williams said. The United States was without 2022 Player of the Year Sophia Smith because of a minor foot injury. Megan Rapinoe also didn't travel with the team because of an ankle injury. It was the national team's first match on HBO Max, U.S. Soccer's new broadcast partner along with TNT and TBS. The World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, kicks off July 20. The title match will be played Aug. 20 in Sydney. The United States has won back-to-back World Cups and will vie for a record third. ___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "normalized_body": "welington new zealand ap malori swanson score twice u woman nation team open year victori host new zealand wednesday scorel first half swanson score header cro triniti rodman 0nd minut alex morgan ade second goal 0th swanson second goal came thre minut later lyn wiliam anoth 0th formerli malori pugh swanson tok chicago cub shortstop dansbi swanson last name pair mari decemb think ultim want posit impact team job score goal tri set peopl score goal swanson said think go perform past coupl month kind review ofseason easi chanc game previou put away match sky stadium first two game betwen team prepar sumer world cup host australia new zealand crowd anounc record fern second game set saturday eden park auckland game first american island nation team met time over unit state domin seri new zealand captain ali riley play angel citi nation woman socer leagu american uncharacteristicali shaki end lose thre last four game got slow start fern lindsey horan wide open front net shot 0th stope slide new zealand goalkep erin naylor midg purc shot distanc 0th carom far post son second goal swanson sube wiliam hadnt play nation team month hamstr injuri requir surgeri fel amaz give teamat theyv ben whole way suport like got lyn fel incred wiliam said unit state without player year sophia smith minor fot injuri megan rapino also didnt travel team ankl injuri nation team first match hbo max u socer new broadcast partner along tnt tb world cup cohost australia new zealand kick juli titl match wil play aug sydney unit state backtoback world cup wil vie record third ap socer"}

LJ Cryer added 18 points, and Jalen Bridges finished with 14 for Baylor, which returned to the AP Top 25 this week. \"Just a typical Big 12 basketball game,\" Baylor head coach Scott Drew said. \"A very hard-fought game.

Connor Murphy also scored, and Petr Mrazek made 30 saves.The Blackhawks (12-26-4) won for the fourth time in five games, closing out a 4-3-0 homestand.\"We've been home for a while, so we wanted to leave a good taste in the fans' mouth and give them a show and give them a win tonight,\" Jones said.Buffalo (21-19-3) lost for the fifth time in six games. Tage Thompson, Victor Olofsson and Peyton Krebs scored for the Sabres, and Craig Anderson stopped 22 shots.Chicago trailed 3-1 after two periods, but Jones rallied the Blackhawks in the third. Kurashev got a piece of Jones' shot for his sixth goal at 1:34, and Jones tied it at 3 with a long wrist shot from the from the point with 56 seconds left.Anderson was screened by Blackhawks forward Tyler Johnson on Jones' third goal of the season, and the goaltender felt there should have been an interference call.\"On the replay, from what I'm seeing, obviously I don't make the calls, but his left foot's in the crease, his elbow goes into my glove, not allowing my glove to make the save,\" said Anderson, a native of nearby Park Ridge. Buffalo defenseman Mattias Samuelsson had a shot go off the post before Jones' tying score.\"Couple goalposts in the third period, so it wasn't like we sat back in the third period by any means,\" Sabres coach Don Granato said. \"But we didn't bear down on our chances.\"A streaking Jones took a pass from Johnson in overtime, and his backhand got under Anderson before sliding over the line. Jones yelled and pumped his arm after the puck went in.\"It's nice to see a few go in,\" he said.Chicago jumped in front on Murphy's fourth of the season. The defenseman got a nice pass from Kurashev and beat Anderson with a wrist shot from the right circle 8:41 into the first.Olofsson tied it at 1 when he knocked in a loose puck in front at 12:15, and Buffalo grabbed the lead on Thompson's goal with 6.9 seconds left in the first. Jeff Skinner passed it over to Thompson, who eluded Jones before poking it in.It was Olofsson's third goal in his last four games and No. 18 on the season.
