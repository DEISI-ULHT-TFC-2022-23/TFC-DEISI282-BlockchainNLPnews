All Rights Reserved.How much has the climate changed already? (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin)Relentless drought in China, East Africa, the U.S. West and northern Mexico, devastating floods in Pakistan and Kentucky, scorching heat waves in Europe and the Pacific Northwest, destructive cyclones in southern Africa and intense hurricanes in the U.S. and Central America make up just some of the recent extreme weather events that scientists have long predicted would be more intense with a warming climate.\"With just over one degree of warming since pre-industrial times, we are already seeing more extreme weather patterns,\" said Elizabeth Robinson, director of the Grantham Research Institute in London.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it.  Scientists have been tracking precisely how much the climate has already changed due to human activity. Temperatures around the world have been inching upwards.The average global temperature today, which tends to be compared to estimates for the pre-industrial era that kickstarted the mass burning of fossil fuels, has shot up between 0.9 and 1.2 degrees Celsius (1.6 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1850, in large part due to human activity, according to estimates in the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most of that warming has happened from 1975 onwards, at a rate of 0.15 Celsius (0.27 Fahrenheit) to 0.2 Celsius (0.36 Fahrenheit) per decade. Most people are living in areas that have heated up more than the global average, \"partly that is urbanization -- people move into cities, which are urban heat islands -- and partly populations growing,\" Robinson said. Urban areas, packed with plenty of heat-absorbing infrastructure like roads and buildings and less cooling tree cover, become \"islands\" of warmer weather.Sea levels, which have swelled due to both warming, expanding oceans and the melting of ice over land, have also been jumping up more rapidly. In the twentieth century, seas were rising by about 1.4 millimeters (0.06 inches) a year, but that's doubled to 3.6 millimeters a year (0.14 inches) in the past fifteen years, data suggests. Seas have risen by about 21 to 24 centimeters (8 to 9 inches) so far since 1880 on average, according to estimates, with the IPCC suggesting this will likely be up to 43 to 84 centimeters (17 to 33 inches) by 2100.While the climate and global temperatures have fluctuated throughout the Earth's history, it is the rate of change that is most alarming to researchers. Fossil fuels -- made up of ancient decomposing plants and animals deep in the earth -- have been dug up at extraordinary rates. Scientists are now starting to pinpoint \"details about rates and magnitudes and timing of changes\" as well as the varying impact on regions, said Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb.With the planet already facing the effects of climate change, adapting to hazards is one major way humans can limit the damage. Weather-related disaster deaths are generally trending lower globally as forecasts, preparedness and resilience improves, scientists say.\"The extent to which people are harmed by an extreme weather event is strongly influenced by government policies,\" Robinson said, but added that \"there are limits to adaptation.\"AP Science writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.Why do small degrees of warming matter? (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin)On a thermometer, a tenth of a degree seems tiny, barely noticeable. But small changes in average temperature can reverberate in a global climate to turn into big disasters as weather gets wilder and more extreme in a warmer world.In 2015, countries around the world agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and pursue a goal of curbing warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) as part of the Paris Agreement. Two degrees of difference might not be noticeable if you're gauging the weather outside, but for global average temperatures, these small numbers make a big difference. \"Every tenth of a degree matters,\" is a phrase that climate scientists around the world keep repeating.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it.  The Earth has already warmed at least 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, giving the world around 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.7 Fahrenheit) of more heating before passing the goal and suffering even more catastrophic climate change events, scientists have said. These tenths of a degree are a big deal because the temperatures represent a global average of warming. Some parts of the world, especially land mass and northern latitudes like the Arctic have already warmed more than the 1.1 Celsius average and have far surpassed 1.5 Celsius, according to estimates.It's helpful to look at temperatures like a bell curve, rather than just the average which doesn't reveal \"hidden extremes,\" said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi.\"On the far end where the bell shape is very narrow, that is telling you the odds of very extreme events,\" he said. \"If you have a slight shift of the average of the peak of that bell to the warming direction, what that results in is a substantial decrease in the odds of extremely cold temperatures and a substantial increase in the odds of extremely warm temperatures.\"It's a similar picture with sea level rise, where the average obscures how some places are seeing much higher sea level increases than others, he said. Most nations -- including the world's two largest emitters, the U.S. and China -- aren't on track to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius or even 2 Celsius, according to scientists and experts who track global action on climate change, despite promises to cut their emissions to \"net zero\".If temperatures increase by about 2 more degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the world will experience five times the floods, storms, drought and heat waves, according to estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\"All bets are off\" when it comes to how climate systems will respond to more warming, warned Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb. The threat of some irreversible changes and feedback loops that amplify warming, such as the thawing of permafrost that traps massive amounts of greenhouse gas, could trigger even more heating.\"It's just staggering to think about how many people will be under immediate threat of climate-related extremes in a two degree world,\" Cobb said.Follow AP's climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environmentAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder, left, and his wife Tanya Snyder, listen to head coach Ron Rivera during a news conference at the team's NFL football training facility in Ashburn, Va., in this Thursday, Jan. 2, 2020, file photo. Few NFL teams have managed to lose as much as Washington has since Daniel Snyder was part of a group that purchased the franchise for a then-record 800 million in 1999. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)Dan Snyder's ownership of Washington's NFL franchise has been a matter of considerable debate for years.Some has centered around a lack of success on the field: two playoff game victories since he bought the team in 1999. Recent events have put more heat on Snyder away from football, with a series of scandals and investigations that have spanned three different names for the team. The latest development: District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine announced Thursday that his office is filing a consumer protection civil lawsuit against Snyder, the Commanders, the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. At a news conference, Racine said, \"The evidence shows Mr. Snyder was not only aware of the toxic culture within his organization, he encouraged it and he participated in it.\" A look at what has brought Snyder to this point:Amid a national reckoning over racism in the wake of the George Floyd protests, prominent sponsors FedEx, PepsiCo, Nike and Bank of America called on the team to abandon its old name, which Snyder long vowed never to do. The team launched a review and on July 13 announced it was giving up the name after 87 years.Three days later, the Washington Post reported that 15 female former employees said they were sexually harassed during their time with the team. The team retained attorney Beth Wilkinson's firm to undertake an independent investigation into workplace conduct, which the NFL then took control of overseeing.The next day, Snyder vowed to improve the culture inside the organization, and the league said it would wait for Wilkinson's review before taking any action. A week later, the club rebranded temporarily as the Washington Football Team, a name that lasted two seasons. The Post reported additional examples of workplace sexual harassment inside the organization, along with allegations that Snyder was personally involved.The Post reported a former cheerleader saying Snyder invited her to a hotel room with one of his friends, and that longtime team executive Larry Michael made extra cheerleading videos for the owner showing sensitive material that wasn't made public. Snyder released a statement denying those specific allegations and saying he was unaware of the incidents.Minority owners Fred Smith, Dwight Schar and Bob Rothman, whose shares added up to 40.5 of Washington Football Inc., sued Snyder in federal court in Maryland seeking an injunction to allow them to sell their shares of the team.At his pre-Super Bowl virtual news conference, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell praised the organization, which he said \"has made a lot of changes already.\" That included hiring Jason Wright as team president in August.Goodell said it was good to see those changes, and added he expected Wilkinson's recommendations would add to them. Weeks later, 20 former employees wrote a letter to Goodell, asking the league to release the final report of the investigation when it was completed. In late March, Snyder bought out his minority owners, a move that gave his family total control of the team. Snyder's application for a debt waiver of 450 million was approved by the league's finance committee and then ownership at-large to make it official.The NFL fined the team 10 million and said Snyder would step away from day-to-day operations for several months after Wilkinson's investigation found Washington's workplace to be toxic and unprofessional, especially for women.The team did not lose any draft picks, and no formal suspensions were handed out. The league said Snyder's wife, Tanya, would assume formal operations while he worked on long-term issues such as the search for a new stadium.No written report was released.Amid calls from former employees for the NFL to release the findings of Wilkinson's investigation, members of the U.S. Congress got involved. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, wrote to Goodell on Oct. 21 seeking all documents and communications related to the investigation.A couple of weeks later, the pair of representatives urged the NFL and the team to release individuals from non-disclosure agreements that would prevent them from discussing sexual harassment and workplace issues at the club.In December, after the Post reported Snyder hired lawyers and private investigators that witnesses viewed as attempts to interfere with the investigation, Maloney and Krishnamoorthi asked the league to provide evidence and said, \"These disturbing revelations have only strengthened the Committee's commitment to uncovering the truth in this matter.\"The House Oversight Committee announced Jan. 27 it would hold a roundtable discussion the following week with former employees to discuss workplace misconduct and sexual harassment.Washington unveiled its new name as the Commanders on Feb. 2. During the roundtable the following day, one of the former employees came forward with a new allegation she was sexually harassed by Snyder himself, which he denied. Tiffani Johnston, who worked for the team for eight years starting in 2002 as a cheerleader and marketing manager, told the committee Snyder placed his hand on her thigh without her consent at a team dinner and that he pushed her toward his limousine with his hand on her lower back.The committee continued to push for the full release of the Wilkinson report, asking Goodell to release the full findings by Feb. 14 and threatening \"alternate means of obtaining compliance\" if he did not cooperate.At the Super Bowl in Los Angeles, Goodell defended the NFL's use of an oral, not written, report, saying it was done to protect the identity of anyone who wanted to speak to investigators privately, also saying the league would take over an investigation into the new allegation of sexual harassment made against Snyder.The league hired former U.S. Attorney and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo White to investigate, vowing the results would be released in written form because the allegation was made in a public forum.The House Oversight Committee told the Federal Trade Commission the team may have engaged in potentially unlawful financial conduct, and the NFL said it would look into the most serious allegations. The committee said it found evidence of deceptive business practice over the span of more than a decade, including withholding ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable deposits from fans. A league spokesman said White would review the alleged improprieties, which the team denied a week later in a lengthy letter to the FTC.On June 1, the committee invited Snyder and Goodell to appear at a hearing on workplace culture around the NFL scheduled for later in the month, which it called the next step in the investigation.Two weeks later, a lawyer representing Snyder said he would not testify. Among the reasons given were a lack of assurance about the scope of questioning given the existence of multiple ongoing investigations and a scheduling conflict preventing Snyder from appearing in person.On June 9, the Virginia General Assembly abandoned for the rest of the year a stadium deal that would have brought the Commanders' games to the state. The legislation offering hefty tax incentives had already been languishing amid a series of controversies involving the team when an assistant coach called the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol \"a dust-up.\"Goodell testified virtually on June 22, and the committee released a document accusing Snyder of conducting a \"shadow investigation\" that sought to discredit former employees making accusations of workplace sexual harassment, hired private investigators to intimidate witnesses and used an overseas lawsuit as a pretext to obtain phone records and emails.Asked by one member of the committee whether he would remove Snyder as Washington's owner, Goodell responded, \"I don't have the authority to remove him.\" An NFL owner can only be removed by a three-quarters majority vote of the other owners. After wrangling between his legal team and the committee over the parameters of his testimony, Snyder agreed to appear virtually. Snyder testified for more than 10 hours on July 28. A spokesperson for Snyder said he \"fully addressed all questions about workplace misconduct, described the Commanders' dramatic two-year transformation and expressed hope for the organization's bright future.\"ESPN released a lengthy report detailing Snyder's efforts to influence other owners and the league office to maintain control of the team. ESPN reported, citing anonymous sources, that Snyder hired private investigators and told people he has enough information to expose fellow owners and Goodell.Days later, at the NFL owners' meetings in New York on Oct. 18, Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said there was \"merit to remove\" Snyder -- the first public statement by one of Snyder's counterparts that he should go.During Washington's next game, at home against Green Bay, spectators shouted \"Sell the team!\" when Tanya Snyder was shown on a video board.The Snyders took the first step toward potentially selling the Commanders: The club announced on Nov. 2 that a financial services firm had been hired to \"consider potential transactions.\" Asked if the Snyders were considering selling part or all of the team, which is worth billions of dollars, a spokesperson said, \"We are exploring all options.\"Eight days later, the D.C. attorney general made public his investigation, which he said began in the fall of 2021. As for whether Snyder can avoid the civil suit by ending his ownership, Racine said: \"If he sells the team, he's still a defendant.\"The investigations by White and Congress remain ongoing. The team still does not have a deal for a new stadium and ranks last in the NFL in average home attendance.AP National Writer Howard Fendrich contributed.AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.What's going on with climate change? (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin)Addressing climate change -- a now ubiquitous term for the warming of the planet caused by humans emitting carbon dioxide and methane from coal, oil and natural gas into the atmosphere -- is becoming exponentially more pressing, with the language of scientists, officials and activists becoming more serious with every passing year.The most recent report by the world's top body of climate scientists gave a damning assessment of where the world is headed if more isn't done to curb global warming. Already, more extreme weather events are happening across the globe, from longer, more intense and more frequent droughts and heat waves to devastating floods and wetter hurricanes, attributed at least in part to climate change.How the planet got here, the current and future effects of climate change, and what to do next, are all questions that experts have been researching for decades.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. There may be an uptick in climate-related policy, discussions and activism, but the science isn't all that new.Scientists in the early 1800s began to recognize that some gasses and water vapor could trap heat in the atmosphere. And for the last sixty years, researchers could definitively measure that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were rising, thanks to a CO2-monitoring station at Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Meteorologists in the middle of the twentieth century also started to understand the climate as a \"system that is dynamic, constantly changing, and perhaps also vulnerable to external forcing and alteration,\" said Martin Mahony, a lecturer of human geography at the University of East Anglia who studies the history of climate science and its interactions with politics.  Add to that the knowledge that CO2 levels were going up and scientists started realizing that this could be a major issue.\"In the 1960s, you start getting conferences and workshops on 'the CO2 problem' ... bringing meteorologists together with the geophysicists and other folks to think through the implications of this in very abstract, theoretical terms,\" Mahony said.But it wasn't long before this theoretical puzzle became a serious concern.By the late eighties, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up to assess how much the climate is warming and if humans have anything to do with it. Ever since its first report in 1990, the link between fossil fuels and global warming was clear. Coal, oil and natural gas for electricity, heating, transport, industries like steel and cement-making, and the gasses from agriculture and refrigerants, are burning up the planet.Scientists say that average global temperatures have gone up by around 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the middle of the nineteenth century, causing hotter temperature extremes, rising seas and weather disasters, with experts warning that more catastrophic climate events are on the way as the world warms up further.\"It's not just going to be heatwaves, drought, wildfires and hurricanes. It's going to be water resources, it's going to be food supplies ... it's going to be national security concerns that are going to be more apparent than they are right now,\" said Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb. Those living in the least developed nations or in poorer communities are often the most vulnerable to climate change. Many have called for rich, high-polluting countries, like the U.S. and much of Europe, to pay their share so that developing countries are more resilient to weather extremes and can curb their use of fossil fuels. Known as \"loss and damage\" in climate negotiations, it's an area that nations have struggled to agree on in recent years.In a somewhat rare moment of agreement between rich nations and more climate-vulnerable, low-emitting ones, countries at the U.N.'s annual climate conference in Paris in 2015 did agree to limit warming to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, with the aim of capping the average global temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).Alternatives to fossil fuels, like solar and wind energy, need to be scaled up dramatically if the Paris climate goals are to be met, experts say. Newer technologies, like carbon capture or green hydrogen, which are currently too expensive, untested at scale or both, will also have to be deployed to limit warming. Changes in people's personal lives can also make a difference, although the large reductions come from government policies and choices made by giant corporations, rather than individuals.Although some effects of global warming are locked in, many scientists believe that curbing warming to just a few more tenths of a degree is achievable, but only if drastic action is taken very quickly.Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.How does carbon dioxide trap heat? (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin)That carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat is something scientists have known about for more than a 150 years. The underlying concept behind climate change is simple enough that school children can replicate the chemistry and physics and so can you.The why and how it happens is only a bit more complicated. EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it.Just as a greenhouse traps heat or a blanket keeps you warm, carbon dioxide, methane and other gases -- nicknamed greenhouse gases -- trap heat from the sun that would otherwise bounce back into space. The blanket or greenhouse aren't perfect analogies but they give the right sense of what is happening, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be freezing, scientists said. The greenhouse effect, which is natural but then put on steroids by carbon pollution, is responsible for conditions that make life on Earth possible. But there can be too much of a good thing. Scientists point to the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus as a case example. In fact, former top NASA climate scientist James Hansen, often called the Godfather of global warming, initially was studying what was happening on Venus before he turned to his home planet and accurately warned people about a smaller scale version happening here. Heat from the sun comes through the atmosphere and then bounces back as infrared radiation, a different wavelength than it came in on. If you put your hand over a dark rock on a warm sunny day you may be able to feel that heat heading off Earth. The greenhouse effect is when that heat tries to escape Earth, but some of it is trapped by different chemicals in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane. In the 1820s, French mathematician and scientist Joseph Fourier figured that something keeps Earth warmer than a bare rock out in space: Our atmosphere.\"Our atmosphere, thrown as a barrier across the terrestrial rays, produces a local heightening of the temperature at the Earth's surface,\" Irish physicist John Tyndall said in 1862, identifying water vapor and carbon dioxide as natural greenhouse gases trapping heat. Then in 1896, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius took it one step further and calculated that changes in carbon dioxide may affect the climate.Many classroom and even home kitchen experiments can show this with two plastic soda bottles, some carbon dioxide, air, a strong light bulb or flame and a thermometer. Heat up a bottle with regular air and one filled with carbon dioxide in similar ways, take their temperatures and after a while the carbon dioxide filled one should warm noticeably more.That's because of the geometry, spin and vibration of carbon molecules block the specific infrared wavelength of light that's trying to escape Earth, Mann said. It's a different wavelength than the light heading into the sun.Greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, \"correspond to sort of holes\" in the light spectrum that would otherwise allow heat to escape, but they block the exits, Mann said. But if there are natural greenhouse gases why do small changes in carbon dioxide levels matter?Earth's carbon dioxide levels are about 420 parts per million, compared to 280 before the industrial revolution and the Earth has warmed about 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) in that time. Mann suggests another home experiment. Take a clear bowl of water. Put a few drops, say 0.4 of the water, of black ink in it. \"And the water turns black now,\" Mann said. \"Certain chemicals can have a very potent impact in very low concentrations. It's true of cyanide. That's why we avoid cyanide in even lower concentrations than that. And the ink experiment really drives how much of an influence a small number of very potent molecules can have... And that's what's going on here.\"Follow AP's climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environmentFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at borenbearsAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Alaska's races will unfold in the overhauled ranked-choice system. The system had its inaugural election this summer when Democrat Mary Peltola made history by becoming the first Alaska Native to serve in the House and the first woman to win Alaska's sole congressional seat. (Bill Roth/Anchorage Daily News via AP, File)One voter, one ballot. Sure. But in Alaska this year, that's not the whole story. In a sort of poll within a poll, Alaskans rank their choices as part of a new system that kicked off earlier this year. The first ranked choice contest under the system was an August special election won by Democrat Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native to serve in the Congress and first woman to hold Alaska's only House seat. She emerged from a field that included Republican Sarah Palin to serve the remainder of the term of the late Republican Rep. Don Young, who died in March.The general election includes a rematch in the House race, featuring Peltola, Palin and Republican Nick Begich, with the winner of that contest earning a two-year term. On the ballot as well are as contests for U.S. Senate, House and governor and Legislature.Most Americans are used to casting their ballot for a single person for each office, but with a fierce contest for control of the Senate and House on the line this year, Alaska's races will unfold in the overhauled ranked choice system.So let's take a closer look. Instead of picking a single candidate for office, voters are given the choice to rank who they want to fill a particular seat. This avoids scenarios in which multiple candidates seeking office could result in the winner failing to top 50 of the vote, backers say.Supporters also say ranked voting could lead to more civil elections, with candidates competing not just for an outright victory but for second choice votes, too. Critics argue it can be confusing. Voters rank their choices by preference, with votes being counted in rounds. If a candidate wins over 50 in the first round, it's over. If not, round two starts with the candidate who got the fewest votes in the first round being eliminated. If the eliminated candidate was your vote then your next choice gets your vote in this round. In Alaska, rounds continue until two candidates are left and the one with the most votes wins. Tuesday's vote was just round one. Additional rounds of counting won't happen until Nov. 23. Alaska voters in 2020 approved a system that includes open primaries and ranked voting in general elections and the state Supreme Court upheld the system in a legal challenge earlier this year. Maine was the first state to go with ranked choice voting for certain races, but no others have followed. Massachusetts voters defeated a ballot question on ranked voting in 2020. A handful of cities across the country have implemented ranked voting, notably New York. (It's been a little confusing for them, too.)Military and overseas voters in a number of Southern states have access to it as well, according to the nonpartisan, nonprofit Fair Vote. Nevada voters are voting on a ballot question this year to have open primaries and ranked voting for the general election, but the question must go before voters again in 2024 and pass then in order to go into effect.Candidates for the state's sole House seat include Peltola, Begich, Libertarian Chris Bye and Palin, who was the governor and the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2008. Peltola's victory this summer was a boon to Democrats. Young, a Republican, held the seat for 49 years. In a year when Democrats face headwinds because of inflation and President Joe Biden's sagging approval ratings, a pickup in Alaska would buoy the party. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has been in the Senate nearly 20 years, is seeking reelection in a contest that includes the Donald Trump-endorsed Republican Kelly Tshibaka as well as Democrat Pat Chesbro. The Associated Press declared that race headed to ranked choice between Murkowski and Tshibaka after tallying Tuesday's votes, which effectively eliminated Chesbro and kept the seat in Republican hands. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy is seeking a second term. His challengers are Democrat Les Gara, former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Republican Charlie Pierce.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)A last chance for Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Kylian Mbappe back on the biggest stage of all. Brazil bidding for a record-extending sixth title.One of the most eagerly anticipated World Cups in memory -- as much for off-the-field reasons as those on it -- begins Sunday in Qatar.Thirty-two teams, 64 matches, 29 days. The first World Cup in the Middle East.League play around the world has paused and now soccer's focus is on Qatar, whose national team opens the tournament with a match against Ecuador.Here are a few things to watch when group games get going in the smallest country ever to host a World Cup, where some fans will be staying in floating hotels when they head over to take in the action:Brazil (No. 1 in FIFA ranking). Neymar, Vinicius Junior and the rest of the flair-filled Selecao are peaking at the right time. Is a first World Cup title since 2002 on the horizon?Belgium (No. 2). The \"Golden Generation\" is gradually breaking up but there's still Kevin De Bruyne leading the Belgian charge. There is a doubt about the fitness of Romelu Lukaku, however.Argentina (No. 3). No World Cup title since the days of the great Diego Maradona. This will be the first World Cup since his death in November 2020 and Argentina has improved under coach Lionel Scaloni, with Messi still at its core and leading the team on a 35-match unbeaten run.France (No. 4). The defending champions. Still the country with the most depth to its squad, despite an injury list that includes Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante. Now with Mbappe AND Karim Benzema leading the attack. No team has retained its World Cup title since Brazil in 1962.England (No. 5). The team has hit a bad patch of form -- winless in six games -- but has a strong track record in recent major tournaments. England was a semifinalist at the World Cup in 2018 and a finalist at the European Championship in 2021.Read up on all 32 teams who will be playing in the World Cup.Lionel Messi, Argentina. The seven-time world player of the year might have been saving his 35-year-old legs for one last push at a World Cup winner's medal that, to many, would solidify him as soccer's greatest player. He is in stellar form for Paris Saint-Germain at the moment.Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal. He has won the European Championship but the leading scorer in men's international soccer hasn't played in a World Cup final, let alone won one. He's 37 years old now and no longer first choice at Manchester United -- so make the most of him while you can.Kylian Mbappe, France. The star of the last World Cup at the age of 19 and he is only getting better. The speedy striker could match Brazil great Pele in being a champion at his first two World Cups.Kevin De Bruyne, Belgium. Widely regarded as the world's best midfielder, his driving runs and crossing are among the best sights in soccer. Belgium will be thankful he is arriving in Qatar healthy.Neymar, Brazil. Often overshadowed by Mbappe and Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, still the main man for Brazil. Watch out for tricks and flicks, and some histrionics, too.Get ready for a feast of soccer. There are eight groups of four teams, with the top two advancing to the 16-team knockout stage.There will be four games back-to-back per day -- yes, four! -- for most of the first two sets of group games, then simultaneous kickoffs for the last two games in each group.There'll be no break for the knockout stage, which begins the day after the group stage ends. The first day without soccer comes on Dec. 7 -- the 17th day of competition.Qatar vs. Ecuador, Sunday. The first match of the tournament and always a date to save on the calendar.Argentina vs. Mexico, Nov. 26. The first of the big continental rivalries in the group stage, with Messi potentially sealing his and Argentina's spot in the last 16.Spain vs. Germany, Nov. 27. Surely there can't have been many bigger group-stage matches than this at a World Cup? Two recent champions, two giants of European and world soccer.Iran vs. United States, Nov. 29. It has been labeled as \"The Mother of All Games Part II.\" Just like at the World Cup in 1998, the two countries will meet in the group stage in a politically charged matchup. Diplomatic relations have yet to be restored between the nations since being severed in 1980.Ghana vs. Uruguay, Dec. 2. Anyone remember the night of July 2, 2010? In the last minute of extra time in a World Cup quarterfinal match between Uruguay and Ghana, Luis Suarez deliberately stopped the ball with his hand on the goalline, got sent off, only for Ghana to miss the penalty and lose in a shootout as Suarez celebrated on the sideline. Revenge would be sweet for Ghana.Injuries have hit some of the world's best players ahead of the tournament.Among those definitely missing are France midfielders Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante, Germany forward Timo Werner and England defender Reece James.The following are carrying injuries: Lukaku, South Korea forward Son Heung-min, Senegal forward Sadio Mane and Argentina forward Paulo Dybala.For more AP coverage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, go to https://apnews.com/hub/world-cupand follow the AP on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Energy for industries like steel and iron, electricity to turn the lights on in homes and buildings, and gas to fuel up cars, ships and planes, all pump carbon dioxide into the air if they're not coming from renewable sources. Agricultural practices, like deforestation and livestock, make up almost a fifth of the world's emissions. Waste such as landfill, leaks from oil and gas extraction and processes like cement-making which makes carbon dioxide as a byproduct also emit greenhouse gasses.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. Carbon dioxide accounts for over three quarters of all human-caused greenhouse gases. Methane, mostly from agriculture, coal mining and disturbing peatlands and wetlands which naturally hold in the gas, makes up about 16 of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide from agriculture practices and fluorinated gases from refrigerants are the remainder.Some of these gases stick around longer than others. It's estimated that carbon dioxide can hang around in the air for 200 years or longer, so coal burned at the start of the industrial era would still be warming up the planet today. In contrast, methane, which is about 81 times more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide, lasts in the atmosphere for about a dozen years.\"Global warming is caused by accumulation of greenhouse gases over time in the atmosphere, which builds higher concentration,\" said Professor Shobhakar Dhakal, one of the lead authors of a report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \"Historical emissions, which refers to accumulated emissions over time, is important to consider,\" he added.But humans are still expelling a vast amounts of carbon into the air today. Emissions between 2010 and 2019 were higher than any previous decade in human history.Net emissions from 1850 to 2019 were approximately 2,400 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Of these, 58 occurred between 1850 and 1989 -- a 139 year period -- with the remaining 42 created between 1990 and 2019 -- just 29 years, according to the latest IPCC estimates. About 17 of emissions since 1850 occurred between 2010 and 2019.  Rapidly growing urban sprawls around the world are accounting for more greenhouse gases poured into the air with every passing year, the report said.\"We are still in an age of fossil fuels as a global society,\" said Professor Jan Christoph Minx, a lead author of the IPCC report and a climate scientist based in Germany. \"We often forget that we have not managed yet to reverse the more than 250-year mega trend of global emissions growth.\"Minx said that any reductions by making systems more efficient or changing the sources of energy to more sustainable ones has been less than the increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings.\"The first step, is to reach peak emissions and enter an age of emissions reductions where every year we emit less and less greenhouse gases globally,\" he added.Follow AP's climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environmentFollow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at sibi123Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.How do we know humans triggered warming? (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin)Call it Law and Order: Climate Change. Scientists used detective work to pinpoint the prime suspect in Earth's warming: us.They proved it couldn't be anything but carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it.For more than 30 years top scientists from across the globe have worked together every several years to draft a report on climate change and what causes it and with each report -- and increases in global temperatures -- they have become more and more certain that climate change is caused by human activities. In the latest version of their report they said: \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\" Scientists -- including the late Ralph Cicerone, the former president of the National Academy of Scientists -- have told The Associated Press their confidence in climate change being a human caused problem is equivalent to their certainty in understanding that cigarettes are deadly.One way to show humans caused the warming \"is by eliminating everything else,\" said Princeton University climate scientist Gabe Vecchi. Scientists can calculate how much heat different suspects trap, using a complex understanding of chemistry and physics and feeding that into computer simulations that have been generally accurate in portraying climate, past and future. They measure what they call radiative forcing in watts per meter squared. The first and most frequent natural suspect is the sun. The sun is what warms Earth in general providing about 1,361 watts per meter squared of heat, year in year out. That's the baseline, the delicate balance that makes Earth livable. Changes in energy coming from the sun have been minimal, about one-tenth of a watt per meter squared, scientists calculate. But carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is now trapping heat to the level of 2.07 watts per meter squared, more than 20 times that of the changes in the sun, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Methane, another powerful heat-trapping gas, is at 0.5 watts per meter square. The sun's 11-year cycle goes through regular but small ups and downs, but that doesn't seem to change Earth's temperature. And if anything the ever so slight changes in 11-year-average solar irradiance have been shifting downward, according to NASA calculations, with the space agency concluding \"it is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past century.\"In other words, the sun had an alibi.The other natural suspects -- volcanoes and cosmic rays -- had even less influence during the last 150 years of warming, scientists conclude.The other way to show that it is carbon dioxide causing warming is by building what Vecchi calls \"a causal chain.\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records measured on a Hawaiian volcano show rising carbon dioxide levels as do ice records that go back thousands of years. But the key is what type of carbon dioxide.There are three types of carbon-containing material. Some contain light carbon, or carbon-12. Some contain heavy carbon or carbon-13 and still others contain radioactive carbon-14.Over the last century or so, there's more carbon-12 in the atmosphere compared to carbon-13 and less carbon-14 in recent decades, according to NOAA. Carbon-12 is essentially fossil carbon from long ago, as in fossil fuels. So the change in the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 tells scientists the carbon in the air is more from burning fossil fuels than natural carbon, Vecchi said.That's the fingerprint of burning coal, oil and natural gas.Follow AP's climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environmentFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at borenbearsAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.The November midterm elections will determine which parties take control over the House and the Senate, ultimately defining the fate of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda. (Oct. 14)Why has The Associated Press tallied votes and declared winners in U.S. elections since the middle of the 19th century? Because the Founding Fathers didn't establish a national clearinghouse for counting the vote, and the states all do it a little differently.So every U.S. election night, The Associated Press counts the nation's votes, tallying millions of ballots and determining which candidates have won their races. It's been done that way since 1848, when the AP declared the election of Zachary Taylor as president.Here's the rundown on the AP's role in election race calling:Basically, no one wanted to wait for weeks to find out who won elections.The Founding Fathers set up the Electoral College -- a series of state elections to pick the president -- to empower states in terms of their own elections processes. But they didn't stand up a centralized entity to count every citizen's vote, unlike in other democracies.Instead, each state determines its own voting rules, laws and procedures, including when polls close, which means counting doesn't happen all at once. \"Once we split it into 50 parts, with 50 sets of rules, it's a big job to try to compile all of that,\" said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. \"Especially if you're aiming to get a timely report out.\"News organizations began tallying votes themselves, including the AP, which AP Election Decision Editor Stephen Ohlemacher said began with \"our own version of the Pony Express,\" gathering vote totals from far-flung areas in the 1848 election. As technology evolved, so did that process, with AP eventually transmitting vote counts by teletype to centralized race-calling operations on the East Coast.Even in general elections, states used to vote on different days, until the advanced technology of knowing how other places had voted led to the practice of a single Election Day.U.S. television networks began doing their own analyses in the 1960 race between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, examining data and calling winners one state at a time. AP now uses a network of thousands of stringers and vote center clerks who take feeds, scrape official state websites for data and electronically add up votes across the country.There is a national elections entity, the Federal Election Commission, which regulates some aspects of federal elections, like administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws, and financing of federal campaigns. But the FEC has no oversight over election results, laws or vote counting.Yes. In 1948, the Chicago Daily Tribune famously splayed \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" across the front page when early numbers made it look like Thomas Dewey was ahead. The tide turned, and President Harry S. Truman defied pollsters by scoring an upset victory.In 2000, the major TV networks and the AP called Florida for Democrat Al Gore, relying largely on Election Day polling. As the votes were counted everyone reversed course. The networks declared that Republican George W. Bush had carried the state, only to later retract that decision, too. The AP held off on making the second call, deeming the race too close. More than a month later, a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court stopped a recount and locked in Bush's narrow victory.\"It was a very tense situation,\" Ohlemacher said. \"Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to not make a call.\"By two decades later, the AP's process had further evolved, and in 2020, the AP was 99.9 accurate in all the race calls it made and perfect in declaring winners in the presidential and congressional races in each state.There were criticisms after the contentious 2020 presidential election, which saw challenges to the results from then-President Donald Trump and his allies in a number of states where he lost. After the AP and the major networks called the presidential race for Democrat Joe Biden, Trump tweeted: \"Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?\"Touting baseless claims of widespread voter fraud in the days after the election, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani pointed out that the media have no official role in deciding who becomes the U.S. president.That's true, but it doesn't appear there are any major moves to change that system.And while control of the U.S. House and Senate are hotly contested in this year's midterm elections, the fact that a presidential race isn't on the ballot could alleviate concerns about the media's role, Edmonds said.\"The question about who will control the House or Senate, that almost rises to the level of who will be elected president, though,\" he said.Winners may have been called, and concessions may -- or may not -- have been made, but voting itself is over when polls close on Election Day. There's still more work to do, as local election officials count and verify results through the canvass and certification process.That means that race calls are made before results are official.

Phillip)Trey Mancini and Chas McCormick buoyed the Astros with clutch defensive plays in Game 5 of the World Series.Defend home turf, and Houston will again be world champions.The Astros and Phillies travel Friday to Texas, where Game 6 will be played a night later. Houston is on the brink of its second title -- the team's 2017 championship was later tainted by a cheating scandal -- after winning 3-2 in Philadelphia on Thursday night.Justin Verlander got his first Fall Classic victory in nine starts. Teammates feted the 244-game winner like a rookie, putting him in a laundry cart and wheeling him into the showers.Mancini preserved a slim lead in the eighth inning with what seemed like the play of the game, smothering Kyle Schwarber's sharp grounder at first base to strand two runners.Then McCormick made the play of a lifetime, leaping into a chain-link fence in right-center to snag J.T. Realmuto's smash in the ninth. He crashed to the warning track with the ball in his mitt -- prompting thousands to put their hands on their heads in disbelief.\"I thought he hit it out,\" McCormick said.With the Astros leading 3-2 in the best-of-seven Series, left-hander Framber Valdez is set to pitch Game 6 against Phillies righty Zack Wheeler. Valdez allowed one run, four hits and three walks over 6 1/3 innings in Game 2, while Wheeler gave up five runs -- four earned -- and three walks over five innings, including Alex Bregman's two-run homer.SERIES SCHEDULE (All times ET)Game 6: Saturday in Houston, 8:03 p.m., FOXGame 7 (if necessary): Sunday in Houston, 8:03 p.m., FOXExcept for Bryce Harper, the Phillies' best sluggers have gone cold in the World Series.The good news: Philadelphia ended an 0-for-20 drought with runners in scoring position on Jean Segura's RBI single in the eighth inning of Game 5. The bad news: the drought was behind only the 1980 Royals (22 at-bats) and 1966 Dodgers (22) for worst in World Series history.The Phillies left 12 runners on base and went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position. Realmuto, Rhys Hoskins, Nick Castellanos and Bryson Stott went a combined 0 for 17.\"Sometimes you go through times when you don't hit with runners in scoring position and then three days later everybody's getting hits,\" manager Rob Thomson said. \"So we've just got to keep battling, that's all.\"The Phillies don't have three days. They have until Saturday to find hits in those slumbering bats.In the biggest moments all postseason, the Houston Astros have been able to count on Jeremy Pena.And then some.The 25-year-old Pena did it again Thursday night, putting on a terrific all-around performance that helped the Astros hold off the Phillies. He became the first rookie shortstop to homer in the World Series, added two key singles and made a critical leaping catch in Game 5.\"Rookie or not rookie, it doesn't matter,\" Pena said. \"We're in the World Series. You just go out and play. Go compete and let the best man win.\"Having already won the AL Championship Series MVP award and a Gold Glove in the last two weeks, the emerging star from the Dominican Republic helped Houston move one win away from the ultimate prize -- the World Series trophy.\"I talked to him earlier in the year about being ready, especially in a clutch situation, and to remain aggressive. And he works at it. He works at his game,\" Astros manager Dusty Baker said. \"Every once in a while these guys come along -- not that often. But it just goes to show you, I mean, his future is very, very bright.\"It's hard to imagine now the Astros started the season with many fans wondering how in the world they would replace All-Star shortstop Carlos Correa, who signed with Minnesota as a free agent.\"I never saw it as having to fill shoes,\" Pena said. \"I just had to come in and be myself, play my game.\" Baker has a fuzzy little theory about why teams play better at home.\"If you got a dog, he don't care if you struck out three or four times,\" the veteran manager said before Game 5 of the World Series.Houston returns to Minute Maid Park this weekend needing to win one of two potential games for a title. History is in the Astros' favor. Home teams went 1,296-1,134 this season, a .533 winning percentage, and are 22-17 in the postseason. \"You got the home crowd, you're familiar with your surroundings, you're familiar with the caroms, you're familiar with the playing surface, and you get to sleep in your own bed,\" Baker said. \"How come most teams don't play as well on the road as they do at home? There's got to be a reason. You don't have to eat in restaurants. You can eat at home or your favorite restaurant. There's a lot of positives.\"\"Most of the time you have your kids telling you after you struck out three or four times that, dad, it's going to be OK. I mean, all that matters.\"AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Atlantic Records/Highbridge The Label, left, Island Records/Interscope, center, and Loyaute/Glassnote Records via AP)Here's a collection curated by The Associated Press' entertainment journalists of what's arriving on TV, streaming services and music and video game platforms this week.-- Elvis, Elton John and Freddie Mercury have all gotten the biopic treatment. Now, it's finally Weird Al's turn. In \"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,\" Daniel Radcliffe plays the parody pro through his life -- or, at least, a version of his life. Yankovic, himself, co-wrote and co-produced \"Weird,\" directed by Eric Appel. And, as you might expect, the \"White and Nerdy\" singer-songwriter fills the tale with plenty of satirical touches nodding to the usual conventions of the music biopic. Yet it's also full of surprises. In my interview with Yankovic and Radcliffe, Yankovic said \"Weird\" \"is funny because it shouldn't exist.\" \"Weird,\" Roku's first original film, streams Friday via the streaming device.-- Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) is on the case, again. The Netflix sequel \"Enola Holmes 2,\" debuting Friday, quickly follows up the charming 2020 film that adapted Nancy Springer's book series and Arthur Conan Doyle spinoff. The sequel teams the younger Holmes with her famous older brother detective (Henry Cavill) for a multithreaded mystery that picks up some of the original's strands (Helena Bonham Carter returns as Enola's mother) while extending into the working conditions of 19th century London factories.-- In her first leading role in four years, Jennifer Lawrence stars in, and produces, \"Causeway,\" Lila Neugebauer's drama about a U.S. soldier named Lynsey (Lawrence) rehabbing at home in New Orleans after a brain injury suffered while on tour in Afghanistan. A gentle indie about trauma and recovery, \"Causeway\" is lifted by the warmth of Brian Tyree Henry, who plays a local mechanic with his own painful past who befriends Lynsey. Debuts Friday, on Apple TV. ( Read AP's review.)-- AP Film Writer Jake Coyle-- A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie returns with his fourth studio album and it shows a lot of range. Singles from \"Me vs. Myself,\" out Friday, include the languid \"Take Shots,\" featuring Tory Lanez, a team up with H.E.R. for the pop-leaning banger \"Playa\" and working with Roddy Ricch on \"B.R.O. (Better Ride Out),\" with the lyrics: \"I came from the bottom, I came straight out of poverty/I had to look around to see who's with me and not with me.\" Boogie can also be heard as the featured guest on Pink Sweat's sexy \"Lay Up N' Chill,\" where the lyrics go: \"Sippin' on that rose really get you in your feels.\"-- Not many synth-pop bands get to record in the Louvre museum in Paris, but Phoenix are one of the lucky ones. Their 10-track \"Alpha Zulu,\" set for release on Friday, was captured in a wing at the world-famous museum. The band's first album since 2017's \"Ti Amo\" has produced the single \"Tonight,\" a catchy duet with Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig that unites the band's lovely melodies with their trademark odd lyrics: \"Could I be the best to jump ahead/Your feet are hurting less with moccasins.\" Other singles include \"All Eyes on Me\" and \"My Elixir\" and \"Winter Solstice.\"-- Ireland has given us so many great artists -- Sinead O'Connor, U2, Niall Horan, Hozier and Glen Hansard. Dermot Kennedy may be the nation's next big thing, judging by his second album, \"Sonder.\" Kennedy, with his expressive voice and impassioned songs, has amassed nearly 4 billion streams across platforms and has the best-selling debut album in Ireland of this millennium, \"Without Fear.\" The new album from the singer-songwriter is preceded by the singles \"Dreamer,\" a piano-driven ballad, and the wistful, dace track \"Something to Someone.\"-- AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy-- George Lopez's new sitcom is a family affair. In NBC's \"Lopez vs. Lopez,\" the actor-comedian stars opposite real-life offspring, Mayan Lopez. Their fictional versions of dad and daughter are unlikely roommates with a rocky relationship. The 2002-07 comedy \"George Lopez\" remains one of the few Latino-led hits on TV, which continues to struggle with depicting America's second-largest ethnic or racial group behind non-Latino whites. \"Lopez vs. Lopez,\" with Selenis Leyva and Al Madrigal in the cast, debuts 8 p.m. Eastern Friday.-- Abrupt cancellations and unresolved stories used to be a common affront to viewers. Now other platforms can come to the aid of an axed series, as is the case with \"Manifest.\" After NBC ended its run at three seasons, it redeemed itself in repeats on Netflix and earned the chance for a proper finish. A total of 20 new episodes will be released in two parts on the streaming service, with the first half out Friday. To recap the premise: An airliner lands safely in New York after a rough flight, but the passengers' relief vanishes when they realize five years have elapsed in a few hours. Stars Melissa Roxburgh, Josh Dallas and J.R. Ramirez are back for the big reveal we want, eventually.-- With patience, even an 18th-century novel can get a TV prequel. It helps that the book at hand is \"Dangerous Liaisons,\" an amorality tale repeatedly adapted for stage and screen, including the Oscar-winning 1988 film. In the new Starz version billed as a \"bold prelude,\" Camille and Valmont are young, in love and in Paris as revolution looms. Alice Englert and Nicholas Denton play the pair destined to become architects of scandal and tragedy as, respectively, the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont. Lesley Manville co-stars as the reigning marquise in the series debuting 9 p.m. Eastern Sunday. -- AP Television Writer Lynn Elber-- Most people associate video games with fast-paced, over-the-top action, but there's a huge audience out there for mellow farming sims like \"Stardew Valley\" and \"Harvest Moon.\" Square Enix's \"Harvestella\" aims for the middle ground. Sure, you can while away hours tending to your crops and chatting with your neighbors. But there's an ever-growing threat looming over your bucolic town, and sooner or later you'll have to put down the hoe and pick up a sword. The demo promises the sort of apocalyptic showdowns Square is known for -- after which, your homegrown zucchini is bound to be so much more satisfying. \"Harvestella\" comes out Friday, for PC and Nintendo Switch.-- Lou KestenCatch up on AP's entertainment coverage here: https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)BANGKOK (AP) -- Shares have advanced in Asia despite a retreat on Wall Street. Hong Kong jumped more than 3 and most other major indexes saw strong gains. A private survey of manufacturers showed some improvement in the business outlook in China, helping to counter renewed concerns over COVID-19 outbreaks in some cities. Investors also were snapping up bargains after recent losses.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 454 points to 15,141.96, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 1.1 at 2,926.46. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 higher, to 27,646.34, while the Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.4 to 2,326.57. The SP/ASX 200 rose 1 to 6,931.00. Markets in New Zealand and Southeast Asia were mostly lower. On Monday, the SP 500, the benchmark for many index funds, notched an 8 gain for the month, its first monthly gain since July. But it closed 0.7 lower for the day, at 3,871.98. It is now down 18.8 for the year. The Nasdaq composite rose 3.9 in October, also marking its first monthly gain in three months. On Monday it shed 1 to 10,988.15.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 14 in the month, lost 0.4 to 32,732.95. The Dow tracks just 30 blue chip companies, far fewer than other indexes, and can have bigger swings than broader indicators like the SP 500. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks was little changed at 1,846.86.A market pullback in August and September, combined with better-than-expected quarterly earnings from many companies, helped put investors in a buying mood in October. Cautious optimism that the Federal Reserve might be ready to begin easing up on the aggressive pace of interest rate hikes as it tries to squash inflation, also helped.Stocks gained ground throughout October as investors shifted their focus to the latest round of corporate earnings. More than half of the companies within the SP 500 have reported results and shown overall earnings growth of 2.3, according to FactSet.Companies have so far given investors a mixed bag of results and forecasts as Wall Street tries to get a better picture of the economy. Inflation remains stubbornly hot and the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively to try and slow down the economy and tame high prices. The strategy risks hitting the brakes too hard on economic growth and sending the economy into a recession.Investors this week will be watching for another extra-large interest rate increase from the Fed. The widespread expectation is for it to push through another increase that's triple the usual size. Wall Street is roughly split on whether it will do the same in December or shift to a smaller increase, according to CME Group.If the Fed signals that it plans to stay on its current pace of rate hikes beyond November, that could lead to a sell-off. Inflation is a global problem. The European Union's statistics agency, Eurostat, reported Monday that inflation hit 10.7 in October, another record in the 19 countries that use the euro currency, fueled by out-of-control prices for natural gas and electricity due to Russia's war in Ukraine. Investors will be closely watching the U.S. government's latest monthly employment report on Friday for any clues on whether the hot jobs market is cooling as inflation squeezes businesses. Wall Street still has plenty of earnings to review from big companies this week. Pfizer will report its results on Tuesday, followed by CVS on Wednesday. Starbucks reports its results on Thursday.In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 58 cents to 87.11 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

All Rights Reserved.From cutting the planet's reliance to fossil fuels to exploring new energy sources, there are already hundreds of potential solutions to address climate change that are being explored. (AP video by Kwiyeon Ha and Rishi Lekhi)As the world warms and extreme weather events mount, governments and corporations have been called on to address climate change by top officials, climate scientists and activists and to curb levels of heating.The planet's temperature has already risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) and the effects will only get worse with every additional tenth of a degree of warming, scientists warn. EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. Scientists and officials agree that it's important to not make matters worse by burning even more fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas -- that emit heat-trapping gases into the air. In a 2021 report, the International Energy Agency said there can be no new investments in fossil fuels if the world wants to reach its climate goals. The most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change said \"immediate and deep\" cuts to dirty fuels were needed.\"Our addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the 2021 climate conference in Glasgow, known as COP26. The world is currently reliant on fossil fuels for much of its electricity, heating and transportation, as well as agriculture and industry. It's hoped that cleaner alternatives -- such as solar and wind energy -- will replace much of that demand. As costs of renewables plummet, more and more energy is being produced in sustainable ways, although the total amount of energy produced globally has also gone up.\"There's been quite a rapid uptake of renewables, but emissions are continuing to rise,\" said Elizabeth Robinson, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment's director. \"We also need to see overall global emissions falling, and at the moment global emissions from fossil fuels are still increasing.\"While renewable energy sources work well for electricity production, other industries -- such as cement-making, steel and shipping -- will be harder to wean off dirty fuels. That's why experts are looking into technologies that may be able to help these specific sectors, as well as the possibility of \"green fuels,\" such as those made out of plant materials or natural waste, known as biofuels. Newer technologies like green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy sources to make hydrogen to use for energy, and carbon capture, which sucks carbon dioxide out of the air, are also being explored but still come with a heavy price tag and are untested on a large scale.Methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but only lasts in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, will also have to be greatly reduced. Countries have vowed to plug methane leaks from oil wells and gas pipelines which would have immediate benefits for curbing warming, scientists say.Robinson also pointed to stopping deforestation and tweaking diets as solutions since forests naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Using land for agriculture, especially for livestock which also requires vast amounts of land for grazing, means forests need to be cleared and more greenhouse gases are emitted into the air. \"This is a very controversial area, but in most higher income countries, most people eat far more meat than they need to,\" Robinson said.In addition to limiting climate change, humans will also need to learn how to live with some warming. Looking at how to rein in warming while simultaneously learning to acclimate is known as \"mitigation and adaptation\" in climate circles. Many officials and scientists say both are needed.\"We've got to do everything,\" said Robinson. \"It's too late to say one thing's better than the other.\" Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Martin)There were no big treats from the Halloween night Powerball drawing, as none of the tickets sold matched all six numbers.The lack of a winner means the next drawing Wednesday night will be for a massive 1.2 billion jackpot.The winning numbers drawn Monday were: white balls 13, 19, 36, 39, 59 and the red power ball 13.The increased jackpot will be the 4th-largest in U.S. history. The biggest prize was a 1.586 billion Powerball jackpot won by three ticketholders in 2016.Massive lottery jackpots have become more common in recent years as lottery officials have adjusted game rules and ticket prices to pump up the top prizes. The most recent tweak came in August, when Powerball officials added an additional drawing day -- going from two a week to three -- to build larger prizes and boost sales.Although the advertised top prize Wednesday will be an estimated 1.2 billion, that is for winners who receive their winnings through an annuity paid over 29 years. Winners almost always opt for cash, which for Wednesday night's drawing will be an estimated 596 million.No one has hit all six numbers since Aug. 3, meaning there have now been 38 consecutive draws without a jackpot winner -- a testament to how slim the odds are of winning the jackpot: 1 in 292.2 million.

Many tell of moving moments with a horse pressed their head to a grieving heart or lowered their face to the earth beneath them as they cried. \"There's a resonance. There's a symbiosis,\" Cacciatore says. \"It's hard to put to words, but it happens. I witness it every day. It's incredible. It's magical.\" (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills)MacKale McGuire performs with other students in his school's rendition of Disney's \"High School Musical\" on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022 in Cadillac, Mich.

You can have tough times. But if you continue to dwell on those tough times while you're having these good times, it's going to ruin the fun of the moment,\" said MacKale, who has been free of cancer for more than five years.

(AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills)There's a saying that adversity makes you stronger. Real life shows that's not always true.But what does determine resilience? Why do some people bounce back after traumatic events? Is it nature? Nurture?Hint: Experts say resilience can be learned, but it's not always easy.Associated Press journalists are talking to people who've been through tough times, and found ways to keep going. Read their stories in this series that explores what resilience looks like.Steeve Biondolillo grew up in an orphanage in Haiti. He was adopted and moved to Idaho. The trauma of his upbringing still haunted him, so his adoptive parents turned to Boys  Girls club. He says supportive adults helped him talk about his life, and feel welcome and calm. Now a college sophomore majoring in social work, he envisions a career working with the needy, helping to give back and nurture others.The tight-knit group of women who call themselves the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies long found joy performing in parades, until tragedy at a Christmas procession took four from their ranks. To go on, survivors decided, they had to take risks on new ways of doing things, with new dancers who hadn't lived their history. Healing together, they found the resolve to return to the parade circuit, including the Main Street where their friends were lost.An Arizona farm is drawing mourning parents from around the globe seeking solace after the loss of a child. Selah Carefarm, just outside the red rocks of Sedona, is a one-of-a-kind patch of land where the grieving can receive counseling and gather with others who've experienced a traumatic loss. They also spend time with dozens of animals, many who have sad stories of their own, as victims of abuse and neglect. The farm is run by an Arizona State University professor, Joanne Cacciatore, whose baby daughter died during delivery in 1994, spurring a search for answers. She's focused her research on grief.MacKale McGuire, a cancer survivor who lost a leg, recently took the stage in his small northern Michigan hometown to star in his school's performance of Disney's \"High School Musical.\" A show that's heavy on dancing was a particular challenge for him because he uses a prosthetic. But MacKale, 18, says he likes to surprise people with what he can do.Jonathan Annicks was 18 when a gunman shot him outside his Chicago home, leaving him paralyzed and in a wheelchair. His shooter was never caught. The AP first reported on his story a few months after the 2016 incident. Since then he's gone to college and become a mentor for others with spinal cord injuries. While he's shown the world a brave face and \"can do\" spirit, the years since the shooting have had ups and downs. It's a reminder that overcoming tragedy can be messy. But, as he has from the start, he's leaned on his family to help get him through. He dreams of a life with even more independence and a family of his own.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Donald Trump's former interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, stood in the cold outside a Loaf 'N Jug gas station in southwestern Montana and weathered a barrage of curses, friendly honks, obscene gestures and shouts of support as he waved a \"Veterans for Zinke\" sign.Love him or hate him, Zinke is a well-known commodity in this Western state with a complicated political record.\"If I get a honk out of a Subaru it's a victory,\" Zinke joked Thursday, referencing the vehicles considered popular among many liberals in the college town of Bozeman. \"Some people express their dissent.\"More than three years after resigning from Trump's Cabinet amid multiple ethics investigations and then going to work for the petroleum industry he used to regulate, Zinke's bid to return to the U.S. House is challenged by a well-financed Democrat on the left, a determined Libertarian on the right -- and by his own reputation among Montana voters. Republican Zinke barely survived June's primary against a hard-right conservative. The former U.S. Navy SEAL has responded with characteristic aplomb to rising hope among Democrats they can defeat him: He boasted later that day in Bozeman during a tour of a wildfire aircraft hangar about his expectation to be on the influential House Appropriations Committee.Once viewed as a moderate, Zinke's rightward shift under Trump and revelations that Zinke lied in two federal ethics cases have exposed him to sharp attacks from Democrat Monica Tranel, a longtime consumer rights attorney who once worked for former Republican U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns. Libertarian John Lamb has toured the state with Tranel attending Democratic-sponsored debates. They've differed sharply on issues but united in painting Zinke as lacking integrity. Montana is rich in fossil fuels and while at Interior, Zinke loosened restrictions on the industry.\"This is a follow-the-money campaign,\" Tranel said. \"His financial interests are definitely served by advocating for fossil fuels. I'm looking at it in terms of what's going to serve Montana.\"It's the first election for a newly drawn House district, created last year after Montana gained a seat following the 2020 census. The Republican-leaning seat includes liberal strongholds such as Missoula and Butte. that offer Tranel a chance to become the first Montana Democrat elected to the House since 1994.A GOP wave swept Montana in recent elections, ending years of residents splitting their votes between Republicans and Democrats.But the June primary revealed Zinke's lackluster support within his party: he won with 42 versus 40 for conservative Al Olszewski. Zinke in an interview waxed nostalgic for more civil times, which he said disappeared after former President Barack Obama left office. Yet he's bitter over a supposed \"deep state\" that supposedly targeted him in Washington. He dismissed as vindictive investigators' reports that Zinke lied during a probe into a Native American casino proposal and about his involvement in a real estate project in his hometown.His legislative priority for Congress is the proposed FEAR Act, for Federal Employees Accountability and Reduction, to make it easier to fire federal workers.\"Those who are abusing power, we should be able to go after them,\" he said. \"I don't think targeting people who are doing wrong is a breach of civility.\"There's been minimal polling in the race and Lamb's presence adds to the uncertainty. Mailers recently sent to voters postmarked from a Democratic-linked group in Washington D.C., described Lamb as the race's \"true conservative\" and panned Zinke. Similar flyers dropped over the weekend bore the Montana GOP logo, according to party officials who denounced them.Outside groups used similar tactics -- promoting a Libertarian to peel away Republican votes -- during Montana's 2012 and 2018 U.S. Senate races. In the 2018 race, a man who registered as a Green Party candidate was on the GOP payroll. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester narrowly won both.Lamb, an antigovernment extremist who thinks the punishments for many Jan. 6 Capitol rioters have been too harsh, denounced Democrats for sending campaign material in his name. He also criticized Zinke, who Lamb said asked him to drop out of the race at an August debate.\"His policies are no better than the Democrats',\" Lamb said. \"There's going to be no changes with either one of those two.\"Just months ago national political trends were breaking in Tranel's favor, when the Supreme Court's rejection of constitutional protections for abortions energized liberals. Worries over crime and inflation now dominate -- indicators more favorable to Republicans, said University of Montana political analyst Robert Saldin.Still, anxiety has grown among Republicans as the race appears to tighten ahead of Nov. 8, spending reports show. A conservative political committee called \"More Jobs Less Government\" spent more than 616,000 on ads opposing Tranel in October. The liberal Big Sky Voters PAC spent about 326,000 attacking Zinke in October.\"It's going to be a lot about Zinke if he ends up losing,\" Saldin said. \"Does the dislike of Zinke extend far enough where some voters vote for Tranel, some vote for the Libertarian, some hold out? Those things can add up.\"Zinke's campaign spent 5.7 million as of Oct. 19, versus 2.6 million for Tranel, according to federal election filings. Of Zinke's itemized donations, 71 are from out of state, compared to about 23 of Tranel's, filings show. Lamb is not spending money.During a recent campaign stop in Butte, Tranel held a news conference alongside climate change activists to deride a looming utility rate hike from NorthWestern Energy, then headed up the street to call a game of bingo at the Belmont Senior Center Senior Arlene Munyon complained to Tranel that Zinke \"doesn't stay in one place,\" a reference to his leaving the House to join Trump's Cabinet months after winning reelection to a second term. Tranel sought to steer the conversation away from Zinke but another resident chimed in to question if Zinke was even a Montana resident because his wife's primary residence is in California.The exchange underscored Tranel's challenge: getting voters to look past Zinke's links to national Republicans and her party's stumbles under President Joe Biden.\"They're trying to make it a generic 'R' versus a generic 'D,'\" Tranel said, referring to the Republican and Democratic parties. \"This is Ryan versus Monica.\"This story has been updated to corrected the spelling of Sen.

(AP Photo/Tim Heitman)Coco Gauff, left, and Jessica Pegula, right, play Yifan Xu and Zhaoxuan Yang in a doubles match at the WTA Finals tennis tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Tim Heitman)FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula were born a decade apart, which does not matter so much when it comes to playing tennis together but definitely creates a barrier when the subject is TikTok.\"We don't really notice the age difference until certain conversations come up,\" Gauff said. \"It's definitely a generation divide.\"Joked Pegula: \"She keeps me young.\"The 28-year-old Pegula is No. 3 in the singles rankings, the 18-year-old Gauff is No. 4, and the two Americans are making their WTA Finals debuts in both singles and doubles this week. No other doubles pairing also has participated in the singles competition at the season-ending tournament for the best of the best in women's tennis since sisters Serena and Venus Williams managed to do that in 2009 (Serena beat Venus in the singles final that year).Pegula, from New York and now based in Florida, had a full day of work as the event began on the temporary indoor hard court at Dickies Arena on Monday. She lost to Maria Sakkari 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) in singles, then teamed with Gauff, a Floridian, for doubles, where they were beaten 6-4, 4-6, 10-7 in a champion's tiebreaker by the Chinese duo of Xu Yifan and Yang Zhaoxuan to close out Day 1 a little past midnight. Because the event uses a round-robin format, Pegula and Gauff -- who makes her singles debut Tuesday against Caroline Garcia -- are still in the running.After briefly pairing in 2021, going 0-2, Gauff and Pegula really thrived in doubles in 2022, collecting three titles and finishing as the runners-up at the French Open in June. Gauff reached No. 1 in the doubles rankings in August and is currently No. 2, one spot ahead of Pegula.The comfort level with each other on the court and \"irl,\" as the kids say -- \"in real life\" for the uninformed -- is much better than when Gauff brings social media slang into the discussion.Particularly if the references come from TikTok, a video-sharing app.\"She'll look at me and say, 'What?!' I'm like, 'You've never seen that?' She's like, 'No,'\" Gauff explained.\"Then,\" she added, \"it becomes awkward.\" Until Gauff pulls out her cellphone to demonstrate what she's talking about, \"and then it will make sense,\" she said. Pegula, whose most recent match was a victory over Sakkari in the final of the Guadalajara Open on Oct. 23, called it \"a reward and a confidence boost for me\" to be in the fields open to only eight singles players and eight doubles teams.Gauff is the youngest American to qualify for the WTA Finals since 1994 and thinks the accomplishment \"just shows my improvement.\"\"I busted onto the scene in a very big way, and a lot of people were having opinions on whether or not I would do well or not,\" said Gauff, who made her Grand Slam debut by reaching Wimbledon's fourth round at age 15. \"This just proves that all the work that I've put in is paying off. Obviously I want to go further.\" They recently became the first two U.S. women in the top four of the singles rankings at the same time since the Williams siblings in 2010.\"We learn from each other ... and that's always kind of pushing us to get better,\" Pegula said. \"It seems like it, because our rankings just keep moving up together simultaneously.\" They are aware of differing in-match personas: Pegula is calmer, Gauff more excitable.And they believe each can benefit from adopting at least a hint of the other's mindset.\"She has really good energy. A lot of first-pumping, jumping around, her athleticism and the youthfulness about her. She's very giggly. She laughs a lot. She's always kind of messing around,\" Pegula said. \"I think just having that kind of energy, especially when we're playing doubles, has kind of taught me to kind of do that more in my singles game, since I'm pretty laid back.\"Ask for Gauff's take on Pegula, and among the words that arise are serious, chill, humble, kind.There is something important to Gauff that is missing from her scouting report on Pegula, however.\"She's not on TikTok at all. If you follow her on Instagram, she's barely on there. I would say Twitter is her most-used platform, and it's still not used a lot,\" Gauff said, chuckling. \"So maybe I can get her on TikTok, eventually.\"With a hint of knowing resignation, Gauff added: \"I doubt it.\"AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner won Major League Baseball's Roberto Clemente Award for character, community involvement and philanthropy on Monday.Turner was presented the award at the World Series shortly before Game 3 was rained out, two years after he was criticized by the commissioner's office for violating coronavirus protocols by celebrating with teammates following the title-winning Game 6.\"I've been fortunate enough to play for, play this game for a while and receive some very nice awards on the field. But this one will be front and center. This is the most meaningful one to me,\" Turner said. The 37-year-old Turner was nominated for the award for the fifth time this year.\"This is one of my favorite days in the baseball calendar, and it is baseball's highest honor to get the Roberto Clemente Award,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said.Clemente, the Hall of Fame outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates, died 50 years ago, in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while delivering aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua.The Justin Turner Foundation, funded by Turner and wife Kourtney in 2016, supports homeless veterans, children and families battling diseases and illnesses, also helps youth baseball organizations and holds an annual golf tournament that raised 650,000 this year for The Dream Center and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.Turner and his wife donated 100,000 to The Dream Center, which supports the homeless and hungry, to fund its foster care intervention program. The center last year renamed its food bank after Turner and his wife.Turner and his wife donated more than 100,000 for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where he serves on the board of directors, and they provided more than 70,000 toys and 14,000 bicycles to children in Los Angeles. They also visit patients at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, serving as hosts of its Walk and Play LA event, and at Cedars Sinai Hospital. They sent get-well videos to children around the country and serve as honorary hosts for CHLA's Walk and Play LA event.The foundation supports AM 570's Veterans Day Radio-a-thon that aids the Dream Center's veterans program.He served as race starter for this year's LA Marathon, helping raise more than 70,000, and his foundation helped renovate Transition House, a downtown Los Angeles facility for homeless veterans.A two-time All-Star, Turner would become eligible for free agency after the World Series if the Dodgers decline a 16 million option in favor of a 2 million buyout.Turner was pulled from Game 6 two years ago after the seventh inning against Tampa Bay when MLB was notified he tested positive for COVID-19. Turner refused instructions from security to leave the field during the postgame celebration, behavior MLB said risked the safety of others.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Employers are prohibited from asking for specific documents because of a worker's citizenship, immigration status or national origin.Giant operates more than 190 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. The Associated Press emailed a message to the company seeking comment on Monday.Under the settlement, Giant will pay an 11,000 civil penalty, train staff in anti-discrimination policies and be subject to departmental monitoring for a three-year period.

Opening statements are set to begin Monday in the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's Los Angeles rape and sexual assault trial. Weinstein is already serving a 23-year-old sentence for a conviction in New York. (Etienne Laurent/Pool Photo via AP, File)LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman testified Monday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her in a hotel room during the Toronto Film Festival in 1991, then did it again when she went to confront him in the same hotel during the same festival 17 years later.Kelly Sipherd told a Los Angeles jury that she was a 24-year-old aspiring actor at the 1991 festival and didn't know who Weinstein was before she met him at a party. She said her friends there were abuzz about the man whose company Miramax had surged to the forefront of independent film and was making its mark at the Oscars.Sipherd said she was charmed by Weinstein at first as they discussed books and films.\"We got along very well,\" she said. \"He was very intelligent. We had a wonderful conversation.\"The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused, but Sipherd agreed Monday to be named through her attorney.She said the two of them left the party for a glass of wine at a nearby cafe, then she went with him to his room at the Four Seasons Hotel because he said he had a script for a film with a role that would be perfect for her.Once there, he went into the bathroom and emerged wearing only an open shirt and holding a hot washcloth, Sipherd testified.\"It all happened very, very very quickly,\" she said. \"I was in shock. It was so unexpected.\"She said he pulled her skirt off, put the washcloth on her and told her \"my wife loves this.\"She testified that she felt \"nauseous, scared, terrified\" and repeatedly told him to stop and asked \"what are you doing?\"She said he held her down and sexually assaulted her with his mouth and his hand. He then climbed on top of her and started to rape her but she was able to slip away and leave the room. Sipherd testified that Weinstein called her at home repeatedly in the weeks that followed, and she often hung up, but eventually spoke to him.\"The encounter that you describe sounds horrifying,\" Weinstein attorney Alan Jackson told Sipherd in his cross-examination, saying Weinstein seemed like someone one would cross the street to avoid at all costs. \"But you didn't walk the other way, or cross the street, or spit on him, you actually took his phone calls.\"Sipherd eventually accepted an offer from him to come to New York and talk to a woman who does casting for him, but took a friend with plans to keep her constantly at her side.\"Your rapist was persuasive in trying to get you to come with him to see him in New York?\" he asked. Sipherd replied, \"yes.\"In New York, she said Weinstein called her in her hotel room from the lobby and told her to get rid of her friend and he was coming up. She refused, and left New York having never seen him or the casting agent.Already serving a 23-year sentence in New York, Weinstein, 70, has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of rape and sexual assault involving five women in Los Angeles and has denied engaging in any non-consensual sex.He is not charged with the alleged assaults described in Monday's testimony. Sipherd, along with three others, is being allowed to testify so prosecutors can attempt to show Weinstein's propensity for the crimes he's charged with.Sipherd testified that she did not see Weinstein again until 2008, when she was 41 and temporarily living at the Four Seasons with her husband and children. She ran into Weinstein in the lobby during that year's festival.\"My blood kind of stopped,\" she said. \"I was very angry.\"When Weinstein's assistant came to her room to say he wanted to meet with her, she agreed.\"I wanted to confront him,\" she said. \"I felt like I was ready to give it to him.\"Once in his room, she remembered asking, \"How does it feel to be in front of the one woman who said no to you?\"Weinstein then dismissed his assistant from the room, and quickly guided Sipherd toward a door. She said before she realized it she was in a closed bathroom with Weinstein, where he was blocking her way out.She said Weinstein grabbed her breasts and masturbated in front of her before letting her leave the room.Jackson said it sounded like Weinstein \"escorted\" her into the bathroom \"politely.\"She replied that she didn't know she was being led into the bathroom.\"You didn't see the sink, the vanity, the mirror?\" Jackson asked.\"It was dark,\" she replied.\"So you went with him in a dark room?\" Jackson said.Then Jackson asked why she didn't leave, or make greater efforts to sound an alarm.\"You find yourself for the second time alone with this rapist and you didn't scream?\" he asked.\"I was mortified and in shock,\" Sipherd said.Sipherd said she didn't tell anyone about the second assault for years because of the \"sheer embarrassment\" of having it happen again.\"I was in shock,\" she said. \"So embarrassed, just so embarrassed.\" Her testimony appears to be the first time she has told her story in a public setting.Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: twitter.com/andyjamesdaltonFor more on the Harvey Weinstein trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/harvey-weinsteinCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - A long line of voters wraps around the Sedgwick County Historic Courthouse in Wichita, Kan., on the last day of early voting on Aug. 1, 2022. Kansas' top elections official warned voters Monday, Oct. 31, 2022, that text messages they were receiving could give them incorrect information about where to vote, but two national groups involved in the texting said they were not trying to confuse or mislead people. (Travis Heying/The Wichita Eagle via AP, File)TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas' top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren't trying to confuse or mislead people.Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn't vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8.Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia.Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on \"high alert\" about potential election misinformation from such texts.Voting Futures later said in follow-up texts that its information may not have been correct. Voto Latino said the problem was a vendor's \"database issue,\" without naming Movement Labs, and said voters would receive corrected information. Both Black Voters Matters and Movement Labs said that group had not endorsed the texts.\"We are deeply sorry for the confusion that these text messages created and have taken steps to correct this situation,\" Black Voters Matter said. \"The last thing we ever want is for our outreach to be confused with intentional disinformation which is sometimes targeted to our communities.\"Movement Labs said in separate tweets for Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter: \"We take full responsibility for these mistakes and have issued correction texts.\"Kansas counties began allowing people to vote in advance in-person Oct. 19, and people don't need a reason to request a mail ballot. While mail ballots must be postmarked Nov. 8 or before, they can still be counted if they arrive in election offices by Nov. 14.Democrats and abortion rights advocates have been watching for misinformation after deceptive texts went to voters on the eve of a statewide vote Aug. 2 decisively rejecting a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the Kansas Constitution. The texts falsely told voters that a yes vote would protect abortion rights, when the opposite was true.Schwab said in a statement that his office doesn't use third parties to send information to voters and urged them to contact state and local officials if they have questions, or go to the VoteKansas.gov website. Voters across the state reported that they started receiving texts Sunday from the three groups about where they could vote, including in the Kansas City area, Wichita and Topeka. \"Voting should be accessible to people and straight-forward, and this complicates that,\" said Alexis Simmons, the Kansas House Democrats' communications director, who received two of the texts Sunday. \"Voting should be empowering.\"This story was first published Oct. 31, 2022. It was updated Nov. 1, 2022, to correct that mail ballots must arrive in county election offices by Nov. 14 to be counted.Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhannaLearn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

(AP Photo/Tim Heitman)FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Maria Sakkari couldn't help but smile a wide smile after taking a pair of tiebreakers to edge Jessica Pegula across more than two hours of big-hitting baseline action in front of a sparse crowd Monday as round-robin singles play began at the WTA Finals.Sure, the No.5-ranked Sakkari was excited about the 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) victory on a temporary indoor hard court at Dickies Arena against No. 3 Pegula in the season-ending tournament, just eight days after losing to the American in the final of another event.For Sakkari, who will face Aryna Sabalenka next, this was of more importance: She got to hang out with her parents and grandmother -- the first time in 4 1/2 years her mom's mom had been in the stands to see the 27-year-old from Greece compete.\"She was like, 'Wow. That was a very high-level match.' She knows tennis really well, because my grandfather was a coach, then my mom was a player, so she traveled with her on the tour. It's not like she's watching her first tennis match ever,\" a beaming Sakkari said. \"It's very nice just to have her around. To be with her. To spend my time a little bit with her and my parents. It's nice, sometimes, to (be with) people that you love and people that are very close to you and were (there) since the beginning.\"Grandma hadn't been on hand for one of Sakkari's matches since she lost to Kiki Bertens in the first round of the Madrid Open in May 2018.\"Nice to have here, for sure -- and see me winning,\" Sakkari said.Later on Day 1, Sabalenka came back to beat two-time Grand Slam runner-up Ons Jabeur 3-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5 after being two points from defeat. The No. 2-ranked Jabeur led 5-3 in the tiebreaker, but Sabalenka grabbed the next four points in a row to force a third set.\"Don't look at the score,\" Sabalenka said she told herself. \"Just keep trying.\"A resigned Jabeur, who meets Pegula on Wednesday in the round-robin format, said afterward: \"I missed my chances.\" In the match that closed out Monday's schedule, Pegula and Coco Gauff were beaten in doubles by Xu Yifan and Yang Zhaoxuan 6-4, 4-6, 10-7 in a champion's tiebreaker that wrapped up a little past midnight. In the day's other doubles match, defending champions Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova defeated Desirae Krawczyk and Demi Schuurs 6-4, 6-3.On Oct. 23, in the final of the Guadalajara Open, Pegula beat Sakkari 6-2, 6-3 to claim the first WTA 1000 title of her career.\"It's never easy against Jess,\" said Sakkari, who was a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist last season but only once made it as far as the fourth round at a major in 2022.That was part of why Sakkari has described going through what she termed a \"dark phase,\" one she snapped out of by reminding herself that she is still a top player.This rematch against Pegula was filled with plenty of momentum swings. Sakkari won the first two games. Pegula took the next three. Sakkari broke to lead 6-5 and serve for the first set. Pegula broke right back when Sakkari flubbed a drop shot, then chucked a ball and walked over to a towel holder and gave it a kick.The second set followed a similar pattern. Sakkari led 3-0. Soon, it was 3-all.Sakkari had an opportunity to close out her first win against a top-five opponent this year when she held two match points at 6-5 in second. But she dropped a backhand into the net on the first, and Pegula delivered a backhand winner on the second.\"Maybe I was a little bit too passive,\" Sakkari said.In the second tiebreaker, she said she realized she needed to be more aggressive, \"because I felt like if you're passive, then the ball does nothing\" on the slow court.Sakkari converted her third match point on a forehand into the net by Pegula, who had won 11 of her preceding 13 matches -- with both losses to No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek.AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Randolph E. Schmid, a retired Associated Press science writer who seldom missed a chance to add a whimsical touch to his authoritative stories, has died. Schmid, 78, died at a nursing home in Falls Church, Virginia, on Sunday, said Mike Bobal, whose late wife was Schmid's cousin. Nursing home workers said he was watching TV and joking with staff the night before. His AP colleagues recalled Schmid -- friends called him Randy -- as a skilled reporter who could find a simple way to present complicated subjects. \"A hallmark of a Schmid story is the light touch, brevity, a pun if possible, and above all speed,\" Seth Borenstein, another AP science writer, wrote for Schmid's retirement in 2011. \"A public relations official at the Smithsonian said his competitors used to complain that he must have gotten tipped off about stories or press conferences. He didn't.\" Schmid's playful use of language was noted by a former boss in Washington. \"Randy was a dedicated science writer but he never skipped an opportunity to try to work a pun into a headline or lead. He was a classic AP newsman through and through,\" said Sandy K. Johnson, who was AP bureau chief in Washington from 1998-2008. One of his last AP stories showcased Schmid's light approach. \"They may not be Sonny and Cher, but certain South American birds sing duets, taking turns as the tune goes along,\" the story began. \"Colleagues stuck on leads often went to Randy for help, so much that we often enlisted him as ghost writer. It was a phrase he hated but a role he cherished,\" Washington news editor Carole Feldman said. Bob Furlow, an AP copy editor, described Schmid as \"a solid reporter while still a champion of the offbeat. He could find nuggets others overlooked in a Census Bureau or other government report that turned into gold on his keyboard.\" Furlow added: \"We'll give him a special salute on Sunday for the switch from Daylight Saving Time -- one of his favorite topics for spinning a few hundred words of fun around the semiannual reminders.\" Schmid, from West Carthage, New York, started with AP as a newsperson in the Albany bureau in 1968 and was correspondent in Memphis from 1969 to 1973 where he periodically had to shoot down rumors that Elvis Presley had died, Mike Bobal said. He moved to AP's Washington bureau in 1973 and worked his way up from newsman to science writer, and he earned a master's in meteorology.\"He loved working for the AP,\" Bobal said. \"He enjoyed trying to get the public to understand things, whether it was the weather or climate change.\" Schmid loved to travel with his wife, Marcia, who died in 2004. Bobal said Schmid \"was never quite the same after that\" but stayed close to Bobal's family and remained gregarious and a voracious reader. \"Randy took absolute glee in finding just the right piece of pop culture to make science news fun and accessible,\" said Lauran Neergaard, an AP medical writer. \"Transformation optics? To Randy, it was like Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. Bacteria in showerheads? He dubbed it the scariest shower news since 'Psycho.' He was unfailingly kind -- and the king of puns. \"Even after retirement, a few times a month Randy would email some new bit of science humor as he checked in with friends and colleagues,\" Neergaard said. \"And when Randy moved to the nursing home, he had a photo collage the AP presented at his retirement -- pictures of some of his favorite stories -- hung directly in front of his bed, ready to reminisce with visitors.\"And many of those stories were memorable. \"Many of the most interesting, fun and important science stories people have read in the last generation,\" Borenstein said, \"were from Randy Schmid.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In the City of Brotherly Love and the undefeated Eagles, Justin Verlander showed the reverse of the first and playfully gave Phillies fans another kind of bird Monday -- with his middle finger as he stepped off Houston's team bus.\"Whole interaction was in jest as all the fans around you were just saying hello in their native tongue,\" Verlander tweeted several hours later. \"So I responded in kind ... all in good fun. I enjoyed the banter.\"One more finger, of course, than you'd need to count the Astros ace's World Series wins, 0-6 with a 6.07 ERA in eight starts.Also the number of days Game 3 of the World Series was delayed -- postponed by rain with the matchup tied 1-1, pushing the entire Fall Classic schedule back one day.\"We waited long enough that we can see on the radar what's coming,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"We had three, actually four different weather people looking at it. Everyone was consistent about this second wave of rain.\"The rainout moved Game 3 to Tuesday night at Citizens Bank Park, when the weather was supposed to be all clear and first lady Jill Biden had planned to attend Game 4. There was a smattering of boos at the ballpark when the washout was announced an hour before the scheduled first pitch on Halloween night.Game 4 will now be played Wednesday and Game 5 is set for the scheduled travel day on Thursday night -- Game 5 will compete with the NFL game that has, of all teams, the Philadelphia Eagles in Houston against the Texans.There will be a travel day on Friday if necessary. That had been the original date of Game 6.Game 6 has been rescheduled for Saturday and Game 7 would be Sunday. All games will start at 8:03 p.m. ET.There has not been a World Series day game since 1987, and it appeared there was little discussion about turning Game 5 on Thursday into a late-afternoon start and keep it away from the NFL as it reigns as a ratings juggernaut. The Eagles-Texans game will stream exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. The World Series airs on Fox.\"For the World Series, an important consideration for us is having the biggest audience we can possibly get, and that's a prime-time audience. That's the reality,\" Manfred said. \"We think we have a great product that fans want to see. And we're going to put the games on when it makes sense to play the games and hope to get a good audience.\"Houston right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. is set to pitch against Phillies lefty Ranger Suarez in Game 3. Noah Syndergaard had been scheduled to start for Philadelphia before the rainout.\"It affects both teams. You just have to turn it off, get a good night's rest and be ready to play tomorrow,\" Astros manager Dusty Baker said. \"It's part of the game. You can't control the weather, so you just deal with it.\"Phillies manager Rob Thomson was fine with the decision by Major League Baseball to postpone the game.\"Everybody would rather play in dry conditions. It's going to be fair for everybody,\" he said.For fans, tickets that were good for Monday night now become valid for Tuesday's game, when the calendar rolls over to November.Game 1 starter Aaron Nola will start for the Phillies in Game 4 against Cristian Javier. Either Syndergaard or Kyle Gibson will start Game 5 for the Phils. Game 2 starter Zack Wheeler takes the mound for Game 6 on extra rest, setting up Suarez to start a possible Game 7 in Houston.Thomson felt confident turning to Suarez in Game 7 even though he was roughed up by the Astros for six runs in three innings on Oct. 4 in his final start of the season.\"Some guys get sped up, get a little excited,\" Thomson said. \"Some guys, their heartbeat stays the same, and Ranger is one of those guys.\"Phillies righty Kyle Gibson could start Game 5 if the Phillies turn to Syndergaard in the bullpen in either of the next two games. Syndergaard went to the outfield after the postponement for some light long tossing in the rain.Gibson would be a stretch after he went 10-8 in 31 starts but none since Oct. 1. His only postseason appearance was 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief in Game 2 of the NLCS on Oct. 19 against the Padres. Gibson went 1-3 with a 9.79 ERA over his last six regular-season starts. Thomson said he could get 60-65 pitches out of Gibson.The Astros and Phillies both worked out on the field Monday before the tarp was put down around 5 p.m. It started to rain about an hour later.\"I'm glad we took some batting practice and played some balls off the wall. That's their real home-field advantage,\" Baker said.And once again, rain intruded on the World Series in Philly.In 2008, the clinching Game 5 actually took three days to play. The Phillies and Tampa Bay were tied when the game was suspended and, after steady rain the next day, Philadelphia won the World Series a day after that.The start of World Series games in Philadelphia in 1993, at Veterans Stadium, and 2009, at Citizens Bank Park, were delayed by rain. This year, the Phillies clinched the NL Championship Series with a win against San Diego on a rainy, gusty Sunday.

DePape is accused of breaking into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's California home and severely beating her husband with a hammer. DePape was known in Berkeley, Calif., as a pro-nudity activist who had picketed naked at protests against local ordinances requiring people to be clothed in public. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)Within hours of the attack on Paul Pelosi, conspiracy theories deflecting blame for the assault on the husband of U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi were already swirling online.It didn't matter that authorities said Paul Pelosi was alone when the suspect broke into the couple's San Francisco home. Or that investigators said they didn't believe the two men knew one another.It didn't even matter that the suspect, David DePape, confessed to investigators that he broke into the Pelosi home to target the speaker.Misleading claims about the assault spread rapidly anyway, and not just thanks to trolls in obscure internet chatrooms. The claims received a major boost from some prominent Republicans and Elon Musk, now the owner of Twitter, one of the world's leading online platforms.On Monday, posts falsely suggesting a personal relationship between Pelosi and the alleged assailant, soared on Twitter, a day after Musk tweeted and deleted a link to an article suggesting one. Musk hasn't said why he linked to the article, or why he deleted his post, which came in response to a tweet from Hillary Clinton that condemned the attack. Twitter did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press on Monday.\"It's like he forgot for a second that he was now the owner of the platform, and not just anther user who can say whatever he wants,\" said Brad Greenspan, a tech entrepreneur and an early investor in MySpace. \"Now, being the owner, there are a whole new set of responsibilities.\"One of several Republicans to amplify the baseless conspiracy theory, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., defended Musk on Monday with a tweet that repeated the misleading claim about \"Paul Pelosi's friend attacking him with a hammer.\"Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., joked about the attack with his own tweet, since deleted, that repeated the conspiracy theory. Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile, ridiculed Paul Pelosi on Twitter with false assertions.The claim also spread to other platforms, including fringe sites like Gab and Truth Social, where posts mocked the 82-year-old victim.San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins on Monday begged other political leaders to be mindful of their comments about the case.\"We of course do not want distorted facts floating around, certainly not in a manner that is further traumatizing a family that has been traumatized enough,\" she said.The posts focusing on Paul Pelosi were just a subset of a recent wave of hateful and conspiracy theory-laden posts that followed Musk's purchase of Twitter. Within just 12 hours of Musk's purchase being finalized Friday, references to a specific racist epithet used to demean Black people shot up by 500, according to an analysis conducted by the Network Contagion Research Institute, a Princeton, New Jersey-based firm that tracks disinformation.Extremism experts and disinformation researchers had warned that the change in ownership could upend Twitter's efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech, especially with this year's midterm elections just days away.Yosef Getachew, director of the media and democracy program at Common Cause, said there's a significant risk that misinformation spreading so soon before the election could confuse or frighten voters, or lead to more polarization or even acts of violence.\"Rather than cave in to conspiracy theorists and propaganda peddlers, we urge Musk to ensure Twitter's rules and enforcement practices reflect our values of democracy and public safety,\" Getachew said.Authorities in San Francisco held a press conference Monday to discuss the latest on the investigation into the attack. DePape told police that he wanted to take Nancy Pelosi hostage and \"break her kneecaps,\" they said.District Attorney Brooke Jenkins debunked several other aspects of the conspiracy theory as well, saying there's no evidence DePape knew Paul Pelosi, and saying Pelosi was alone at home when DePape broke in.While belief in conspiracy theories is nothing new to American history, experts who study disinformation say they can become dangerous when they persuade people to consider violence as an alternative to politics, or when they cause people to ignore inconvenient truths.DePape appears to have authored racist and often rambling online posts in which he questioned the results of the 2020 election, defended former President Donald Trump and echoed QAnon conspiracy theories.QAnon adherents support the belief that Trump is secretly waging a battle against a sect of blood-drinking Satanists who have controlled world events for eons. The movement has been linked to an increasing number of acts of real-world violence in recent years.Social media has sped up the proliferation of conspiracy theories, helped believers organize, and enabled groups to weaponize disinformation for their own ends, according to Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, a group that supports new regulations on platforms.Twitter and other platforms, Haworth said, have \"created a toxic atmosphere where public officials and their families are at risk (and) now online threats are spilling over into real-world violence.\"This story was first published on Oct. 31, 2022.

All Rights Reserved.Police tape blocks a street outside the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband Paul Pelosi in San Francisco, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022. On Monday, Oct. 31, 2022, The Associated Press reported on false and unfounded conspiracy theories about the attack on Paul Pelosi. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)In the days since an assailant broke into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and attacked her husband with a hammer, internet users have amplified false claims that mock the victim and give credence to insidious conspiracy theories about the incident.Baseless and homophobic claims suggesting a personal relationship between Paul Pelosi and the alleged assailant have been shared by prominent figures including elected officials, conservative pundits and Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, who later deleted his post.Authorities have stated that David DePape, 42, broke a glass door of the home early Friday morning and entered with a hammer, zip ties and other supplies, intending to kidnap the Democratic lawmaker. They said he struck Pelosi with a hammer after police arrived at the scene.DePape, who is facing multiple charges including attempted murder, also appears to have written racist and often rambling posts online, including some that questioned the results of the 2020 election, defended former President Donald Trump and echoed QAnon conspiracy theories, as The Associated Press has reported.Here are the facts.CLAIM: This was a \"Domestic Violence Case in a consensual sexual relationship.\"THE FACTS: Zero evidence has been presented to support that claim, which contradicts what law enforcement officials have said and what court documents describe.\"We have nothing to suggest that these two men knew each other prior to this incident,\" San Francisco's district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, told reporters on Sunday. She said during a press conference Monday the attack appeared to be politically motivated.Jenkins' office in a court filing Tuesday detailed the contents of a 911 call Pelosi made early Friday, during which Pelosi confirmed that he did not know DePape. Overhearing the call, DePape said aloud that his name was David and he was a \"friend,\" the filing said. Likewise, an FBI agent's affidavit reports that Pelosi in the 911 call \"conveyed that he does not know who the male is\" and later told a police officer in the ambulance that he had never seen DePape before.DePape told police officers that he went to the home to take Nancy Pelosi hostage, according to the affidavit, and that he viewed her as a \"'leader of the pack' of lies told by the Democratic Party.\" The affidavit was submitted in support of federal charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.CLAIM: DePape was in his underwear when police arrived at the house.THE FACTS: The FBI in its affidavit describes the alleged attacker as wearing shorts with pockets.\"Officers removed a cell phone, cash, clipper cards, and an unidentified card from DEPAPE'sright shorts pocket,\" the affidavit reads.A local news outlet reported the baseless claim that DePape was in his underwear, but it later corrected its story. Pelosi, meanwhile, was asleep in his bed on the second floor of the home when DePape entered and woke him up, according to officials. \"Mr. Pelosi, who was sleeping, was wearing a loose fitting pajama shirt and boxer shorts,\" Jenkins, the district attorney, said Monday.CLAIM: Both DePape and Pelosi were holding hammers when authorities arrived.THE FACTS: The two men were struggling over a single hammer, police confirmed.The false notion that the men were each holding their own hammers erupted after San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said in a Friday news briefing that when officers arrived at the scene, they \"observed Pelosi and the suspect both holding a hammer.\"But Scott later clarified his language, saying that police saw \"Mr. Pelosi and Mr. DePape each with one hand on a single hammer. There was one hammer that the officer observed.\"Scott explained that police then told both men to drop the hammers, and DePape pulled the hammer away and struck Pelosi with it.DePape's account matches this description of events, according to his interview with authorities recorded in the FBI affidavit. The hammer belonged to DePape, the affidavit said.The affidavit also states that law enforcement searched DePape's home and found \"two hammers, a sword, and a pair of rubber and cloth gloves.\"CLAIM: Photo shows DePape filming the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.THE FACTS: That's wrong. The photo in question, published by the AP, was not taken at the Capitol.The image does show DePape holding a camcorder. But it was taken outside of San Francisco City Hall almost a decade ago.AP photographer Eric Risberg captured the image on Dec. 19, 2013. According to the caption, the photo shows DePape recording the nude wedding of Gypsy Taub, a pro-nudity activist. At the time, Taub was marrying another man.CLAIM: Two far-right websites attributed to DePape were created the day of the attack and deleted the next day, proving a left-wing attempt to \"smear\" him.THE FACTS: The websites existed before the attack, and had entries dating back years, according to AP reporting. This claim reflects a misunderstanding of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, an online tool that allows people to visit past versions of websites that users and internet bots have archived. The tool does not show when a website was created. After Pelosi was attacked, journalists researching the man identified as his assailant wrote about web blogs that had been posted under the name David DePape in recent months. The blogs contained political rants and references to the QAnon conspiracy theory.Social media users and conservative websites over the weekend questioned whether these blogs were real, claiming that the Wayback Machine only showed activity on the sites from the past two days. However, an AP reporter viewed entries on the sites that predated the attack, and the domain registration on one of the sites shows it was registered last month by a David DePape.The Wayback Machine also does not include a full history of every website.\"Some sites may not be included because the automated crawlers were unaware of their existence at the time of the crawl,\" reads an online information page about the tool. \"It's also possible that some sites were not archived because they were password protected, blocked by robots.txt, or otherwise inaccessible to our automated systems.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - In this Nov. 16, 2021, photo, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke waits to speak during a campaign stop in San Antonio. Pre-filled voter registration forms sent by O'Rourke's campaign are permitted under Texas law, experts and officials say. Some may have been sent to dead people because of out-of-date databases, but this is not proof of voter fraud. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, file)CLAIM: The campaign of Democrat Beto O'Rourke, who is running for Texas governor, engaged in voter fraud by sending pre-filled voter registration forms to dead people.AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. O'Rourke's campaign did send out partially filled-out forms to encourage people to register before the Texas deadline, a spokesperson for the campaign told The Associated Press. However, experts and government officials say that sending such forms is permitted under Texas law, even if they are sent to dead people because of databases that are not up to date. Even if someone tried to return the form on behalf of a dead person, the applications are verified for eligibility by the state before they are approved. There are additional safeguards, such as signature validation, to protect against fraud if an actual ballot gets mailed on behalf of someone who has died -- a rare occurrence, the AP has reported.THE FACTS: One week out from the midterm elections, some social media users are falsely claiming that O'Rourke's campaign is engaging in voter fraud by trying to illegally register dead people to vote.\"Beto O'Rourke's campaign has also been sending pre-filled registration applications to dead voters,\" a woman said in a video posted to Twitter. \"This is literally right before the November elections and they're sending this to dead voters. This is voter fraud.\"A tweet featuring the video had received more than 20,000 likes and more than 11,000 shares as of Monday.\"Beto O'Rourke's Campaign caught sending out prefilled voter registration to dead voters in Texas !!\" another tweet stated. \"Democrats are trying to steal elections the same way as in 2020.\"O'Rourke's campaign did send out application forms with people's names, birthdays and addresses filled out to remind them to update their voter registration if they'd moved, or to register for the first time, before the Texas deadline on Oct. 11, according to Chris Evans, the campaign's director of communications.Evans acknowledged that the database the campaign uses for such mailings might contain errors. But he noted that all voter registration applications are reviewed by the state of Texas to make sure people who fill them out are eligible to vote.\"An individual who is not eligible would have their application flagged by the state and be unable to successfully register,\" he said.Texas election experts and officials concurred that a campaign sending out registration forms with select portions filled out is legally sound, even if some end up being sent to voters who have died through faulty mailing lists.\"Campaigns and third-party organizations that send people blank voter registration applications are allowed to pre-fill certain portions of the application,\" Sam Taylor, a spokesperson for the Texas secretary of state's office, told the AP.Texas election law allows for such pre-filled applications to already include the voter's name, birthdate and address, Taylor said.He confirmed that all voter registration applications are subject to validation -- including a comparison of information to Texas Department of Public Safety and Social Security Administration records. Individuals reported to those agencies as deceased would fail the validation process.\"There are ample checks in the system to make sure someone cannot register and request a mail-in ballot in the name of a deceased person,\" Taylor said.He also noted that it is common for campaigns and other organizations to use private data sources to send such forms and that those lists can include outdated or inaccurate information.Information in such databases may be outdated or inaccurate because the databases are not updated in real time, said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.\"Look at it from their perspective -- they don't want to mail it to anyone who's deceased because that's going to be a wasted piece of direct mail,\" he said. \"It's quite possible, especially if somebody passed away within 2022, that the death certificate essentially has not been updated in whatever dataset they're using and therefore the person still appears to be living.\"D. Theodore Rave, a professor of law at the University of Texas at Austin with expertise on election law, similarly told the AP that it's not illegal to fill out information such as a name, address and birthday. It would be against state law to fill out other information, such as \"statements that the voter is a U.S. citizen, a resident of the county, not incapacitated, and not a felon,\" he wrote in an email.\"If a partially pre-filled registration form is sent to someone who has died, in all likelihood, nothing at all would happen,\" Rave added. \"If someone else were to attempt to use one of those forms to register in the name of a dead person, that would indeed be fraud under Texas Election Code sec. 276.013, and would subject that person to criminal penalties.\"This is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)CLEVELAND (AP) -- For the first time this season, the Cleveland Browns put it all together and played like a complete team -- offense, defense special teams. Scary, on Halloween.\"It was one of those days where we imposed our will,\" quarterback Jacoby Brissett said.Nick Chubb r ushed for two touchdowns and Myles Garrett and Cleveland's defense frustrated Joe Burrow as the Browns thrashed Cincinnati 32-13 on Monday night, keeping the Bengals star quarterback winless against them.Garrett, who came to FirstEnergy Stadium wearing a Halloween costume, led a fired-up defense that sacked Burrow five times and held the Bengals (4-4) to 229 total yards -- 100 in the first half.\"Myles was very good,\" Browns coach Kevin Stefanki said with a smile. \"He does what No. 95 does. He was playing dominant out there. He is very difficult for people to block one on one. He gets a ton of attention, and when that happens, others are getting one on ones.\"Burrow has already been to the Super Bowl in just three NFL seasons. However, the Ohio native has yet to beat Cleveland, dropping to 0-4 in four career starts against Cincinnati's AFC North rival.The Browns (3-5) ended a four-game losing streak, and in the process saved their season from slipping away as they try to stay competitive while awaiting quarterback Deshaun Watson's return from an 11-game suspension.Garrett was pleased with the performance, but as the Browns head into their bye, he stressed it won't mean anything without another one like it.\"It has to be routine. It has to be the standard,\" he said. \"We have to make sure that everything we did leading up to this game is the same the week after this one. We wave what it takes. We have taken our lumps, but we will show what we have and our dedication to the game and what it takes to get wins in this league because they don't come easily.\"Right now, to get a win like this, and in a dominant fashion, it is showing the guys how good we can really be.\"Brissett ran for a TD and passed for another, leading Cleveland to its fifth straight win over Cincinnati. He completed 17 of 22 for 278 yards and a career-high 133.7 rating while outplaying Burrow.Chubb scored on runs of 3 and 11 yards, and Brissett added a 3-yard TD run and connected with Amari Cooper on a 4-yard pass in the second half as the Browns built a 25-0 lead while playing their best all-around game in 2022.\"The game was 25-0 before you even know it,\" Bengals coach Zac Taylor said. \"We just didn't come back. The worst thing to do against the Cleveland Browns is to give them a two, three score lead with their running game and their pass rush.\"Led by Garrett, Cleveland's defense, which has struggled for most of the season, put relentless pressure on Burrow, who was without top receiver Ja'Marr Chase because of a hip injury.However, even a healthy Chase may not have been enough to help Burrow. He finished 25 of 35 for 232 yards with two TDs and one interception.\"He's one of the elite of the elite in the game,\" Burrow said of Garrett, who finished with 1 1'2 sacks. \"He's always going to make plays like he did tonight.\"Burrow connected on scoring passes in the fourth quarter to Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins, but those only helped him pad his stats and took some sting out of the scoreboard.Garrett set the tone for a scary performance for the Browns by dressing up as Vecna, the sinister alien-like character from the TV series \"Stranger Things.\" This was indeed a strange night as the Browns finally looked like a competent team and recorded a lopsided win after so many close losses.\"We expect him to set the tone for us,\" Brissett said of Garrett. \"He will come up and tell you that he fed off of a lot of those other guys. There were not a lot of places for them to throw the ball tonight, and that was because of the back end but also because of the front end.\"It was Cleveland's second blowout of Cincinnati in the past two years. The Browns thumped the Bengals 41-6 in their first meeting last year.\"They've had our number the last couple of years,\" Burrow said. \"They always play well against us, they have real good players in defense and are really well coached.\"Cincinnati did not allow a second-half touchdown in its first seven games before the Browns scored three TDs after halftime.With the trade deadline Tuesday, Browns running back Kareem Hunt has been involved in rumors for weeks. The chatter about his future began when he demanded to be dealt in August after the team failed to offer him a contract extension.Hunt ran for 42 yards on 11 carries.Former Browns cornerback Joe Haden served as the honorary game captain. He signed a one-day contract to officially retire with Cleveland, which drafted him in the first round in 2010. Haden was a two-time Pro Bowler during seven seasons with the Browns before playing for rival Pittsburgh.Bengals: CB Chidobe Awuzie left the stadium on crutches and his right knee immobilized. ... CB Tre Flowers (hamstring) left in the third.Browns: RT Jack Conklin went to the locker room late in the first half with an undisclosed injury, but returned after halftime.Bengals: Host the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.Browns: Bye week before visiting Miami on Nov. 13.AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)Utah Jazz forward Kelly Olynyk, left, and Memphis Grizzlies center Steven Adams (4) look on after falling on the court during the second half of an NBA basketball game Monday, Oct. 31, 2022, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Playing fearless is fueling success for the Utah Jazz. Lauri Markkanen had 31 points and 10 rebounds, and the Jazz dominated on both ends of the court Monday night in a 121-105 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.Utah repeatedly contested shots, crashed the boards and forced turnovers. On offense, the Jazz were equally relentless in knocking down one outside jumper after another. \"Nobody is backing down or afraid of anything,\" veteran guard Mike Conley said. \"That's who we are. We are that team and it's fun to be around that -- guys who are scrappy that don't care about getting elbowed and don't care about fouling too many times.\" Markkanen made a season-high 11 field goals while shooting 69 from the floor. He made an equally forceful impact as a defender, contesting shots and keeping shooters uncomfortable in the paint. \"He has good feet, and he knows how to use his size and length. He's a legit 7-footer,\" Jazz coach Will Hardy said. \"His size, coupled with his ability to move, makes him a good defender.\"Malik Beasley added a season-high 18 points off the bench for the Jazz. Conley and Collin Sexton chipped in 15 apiece. Utah made 19 3-pointers to earn its second win over Memphis in three days. Ja Morant had 37 points to pace the Grizzlies. Dillon Brooks added 19 points and Tyus Jones chipped in 12. Memphis shot 6 of 26 from 3-point range. \"Everything was on us,\" Morant said. \"We weren't communicating, rotating, and we were just giving them easy looks.\" Morant went 5 for 5 from the floor in the first quarter and helped Memphis grab a 26-23 lead. He had 21 points by halftime. Things unraveled for the Grizzlies in the second period amid a flurry of turnovers and a long shooting drought. Utah held Memphis to a single basket in 6 1/2 minutes. The Jazz also forced eight turnovers during the quarter and scored 10 points off those takeaways.That opened the door for Utah to take control before halftime. The Jazz ripped off a 24-5 run, punctuated by Jordan Clarkson's four-point play, to seize a 54-38 lead. Utah outscored the Grizzlies 38-18 in the second quarter and limited Memphis to 32 shooting from the field. The Jazz also had 38 second-quarter points in their win over the Grizzlies on Saturday night. \"We lost our spirit there in the second quarter and they took advantage,\" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. Utah extended its lead to 23 by the end of the third after making seven 3-pointers in the quarter. Utah unraveled late last season amid reports of locker room strife between former stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This season, the Jazz have made a 180-degree turn with team chemistry. Clarkson said he's having fun and enjoying this season because everyone shares a hunger to prove themselves and it has led to working hard together and communicating well on the court. \"We have a great thing going right now in terms of the vibe in the locker room,\" Clarkson said.

(AP Photo/Tertius Pickard)BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- England and Sri Lanka kept alive their semifinals hopes at the T20 World Cup with crucial wins on Tuesday.England ended New Zealand's undefeated record by 20 runs.Earlier at the Gabba, Sri Lanka rekindled its slim hopes by eliminating Afghanistan by six wickets.New Zealand still leads their group on run rate from England and Australia. On Friday, the Black Caps face Ireland, and Australia plays Afghanistan. England and Sri Lanka meet on Saturday.Jos Buttler and Alex Hales gave England a terrific start with 81 runs in 62 balls. Hales posted 52 off 30 deliveries with seven fours and a six, while Buttler top-scored with 73 in 47 balls with seven fours and two sixes.However, New Zealand fought back to subdue England at the finish, taking four wickets for 23 runs in the space of 14 deliveries. England made 179-6 and the target of 180 proved to be sufficient on a two-paced pitch that slowed down considerably.Fast bowler Mark Wood sent down some unplayable deliveries constantly above 150 kph. He also claimed the fastest ball of the tournament when a delivery to Glenn Phillips was clocked at 154.7 kph.Phillips gave New Zealand a chance.After a brilliant century against Sri Lanka on Saturday, Phillips threatened to snatch the momentum and Moeen Ali didn't help England's cause when he put down the dangerous batter on 15. But with 49 runs gettable from 18 deliveries, Phillips tried to clear medium-pacer Sam Curran over long on but was caught inside the ropes by substitute fielder Chris Jordan. Phillips' 62 came off 36 balls with four fours and three sixes.New Zealand fell short at 159-6 and Curran and Chris Woakes took two wickets apiece to complement Woods. Wanindu Hasaranga claimed 3-13 as Sri Lanka restricted Afghanistan to 144-8. The legspinner is the leading wicket-taker in the competition with 13.Sri Lanka wasn't really tested in its run chase to 148-4. Dhananjaya de Silva posted a half-century, his first since January 2020.De Silva and Kusal Mendis shared a 34-run stand for the second wicket as Sri Lanka got off to a good start. Sri Lanka badly needed it after losing four wickets for eight runs in its previous game inside four overs. Mendis needed nine deliveries to get off the mark but finished on 25 off 27.De Silva was dropped on 39 by Gulbadin Naib as he failed to hold on to a return catch. He scored the winning runs, an elegant cover drive for four off Fazalhaq Farooqi to finish unbeaten on 66, his career-best score. De Silva faced 42 balls and hit six fours and two sixes.Sri Lanka won with nine deliveries to spare.Bhanuka Rajapaksa walked in with Sri Lanka needing 45 in 39 deliveries and played a cameo with 18 from 13, including three fours. Afghanistan may not have star legspinner Rashid Khan for its last group match against Australia. He limped off the pitch after hurting his knee while fielding.More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Shanghai Disneyland was closed and visitors temporarily kept in the park for virus testing, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022, the city government announced, while social media posts said some amusements kept operating for guests who were blocked from leaving. (AP Photo/Chen Si, File)BEIJING (AP) -- Shanghai Disneyland was closed and visitors temporarily kept in the park for virus testing, the city government announced, while social media posts said some amusements kept operating for guests who were blocked from leaving.The park closed Monday for testing of staff and visitors, Walt Disney Co. and the city government announced. No details of a possible outbreak were released.\"All guests have exited the park\" following \"expedited COVID testing,\" Disney said Tuesday in a statement. It did not say when the park might reopen.While other countries are easing anti-virus measures, China has stuck to a severe \"Zero COVID\" strategy that aims to isolate every case. Outbreaks in Shanghai in March led to a shutdown that confined most of its 25 million people to their homes for two months.On Friday, 1.3 million residents of Shanghai's downtown Yangpu district were ordered to stay at home while they underwent virus tests.The city government appealed to anyone who had visited the Shanghai Disney Resort since Thursday to undergo three days of nucleic acid testing and avoid gathering in groups.A statement by Disney on Monday said parts of the resort closed due to anti-virus regulations but gave no indication visitors were kept inside. It said Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown and Wishing Star Park were closed while two hotels were operating normally.Some rides and other amusements kept operating Monday while visitors were tested, according to social media posts.A video on the popular Sina Weibo platform showed an employee in a mask saying to guests, \"please return and take a tour in the park.

All Rights Reserved.S. Korea fires 3 test missiles in response to North launches      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea says it has conducted air-to-surface missile tests in response to North Korean missile launches. South Korea's military says its fighter jets fired three precision-guided missiles Wednesday near the rivals' eastern border. It says the launches were in reaction to a barrage of North Korean missiles tests earlier Wednesday. South Korea says one of the North Korean missiles landed near the sea border. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded in South Korea after the North fired about a dozen missiles in its direction Wednesday, at least one of them landing near the rivals' tense sea border.3 tragedies in Asia take hundreds of lives in 1 month      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- More than 400 people died in October in a series of crowd-related disasters in Asia, when a bridge packed with revelers collapsed in India, Halloween partiers were crushed in South Korea's capital, and spectators fled a stadium in Indonesia after police fired tear gas. The dynamics in the three situations were distinct, though experts say poor planning and crowd management contributed to the disasters in Indonesia and South Korea. In India, authorities are investigating whether the recently repaired bridge was properly inspected. ___ In Seoul, 156 people died when more than 100,000 flocked to the popular nightlife district of Itaewon on Saturday for Halloween celebrations, the first since the country's strict COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.S. Korea officials admit responsibility in Halloween tragedy      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean officials admitted responsibility and apologized on Tuesday for failures in preventing and responding to a Halloween crowd surge that killed more than 150 people and left citizens shocked and angry. The government is facing growing public scrutiny over whether the crush Saturday night in Seoul's Itaewon district, a popular nightlife neighborhood, could have been prevented and who should take responsibility for the country's worst disaster in years. National police chief Yoon Hee Keun said an initial investigation found there were many urgent calls from citizens notifying authorities about the potential danger of the crowd gathering in Itaewon.Seoul's Halloween victims primarily women, young people      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The narrow street in Seoul's popular Itaewon neighborhood was already packed with people celebrating Halloween as high school student Eunseo Kim and her friend pushed themselves into the crowd. Lines of people waiting for their faces to be painted or to get into restaurants slowed the flow of revelers walking through the party zone in South Korea's capital. As the 17-year-old slowly worked her way up the narrow alley on a hill, the crowd became increasingly compressed. \"Women were repeatedly saying 'please don't push,' as men were saying 'push, push,'\" she recalled. She began struggling to breathe as her chest was crushed.Climate Migration: Nomads move to towns in warming Ladakh      KHARNAK, India (AP) -- For decades, Konchok Dorjey grazed the world's finest cashmere-producing goats in the arid, treeless Kharnak village in India's Ladakh region, a high mountainous cold desert that borders China and Pakistan. But a decade ago, the 45-year-old nomad gave up his pastoral life in search of a better future for his family. He sold off his animals and migrated to an urban settlement in the outskirts of a regional town called Leh. Dorjey now lives with his wife, two daughters and a son in Kharnakling, where scores of other nomadic families from his native village have also settled in the last two decades.Friends, families mourn lives lost in India bridge disaster      MORBI, India (AP) -- Naseema Ben Shamdar and seven members of her family were making their way across Morbi's jam-packed suspension bridge when its cables gave way Sunday, plunging them into the deep, wide waters of Machchu river and killing 134 people. In just seconds, Naseema was gasping for breath and trying desperately to swim to shore, struggling through a quagmire of mud and weeds. All around her, people were pleading for help. Some of those who fell into the river were stuck in its deep silt. Some were knocked unconscious by the aluminum walkway that crashed into the water along with the hundreds of people who had been walking on it.Philippine schools ordered to reopen after virus lockdowns      MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Millions of students trooped back to public schools across the Philippines on Wednesday as the government enforced the mandatory resumption of in-person classes after more than two years of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Daunting problems hounded the reopening of classes in grade and high schools in several cities and provinces -- primarily the extensive damage and flooding caused by Tropical Storm Nalgae, which blew out of the archipelago on Sunday. The storm left more than 130 people dead and a trail of destruction, including damaged school buildings. Shortages in teachers and classrooms have also been a longstanding problem.After tragic crush, lost shoes await owners at Seoul gym      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Days after more than 150 Halloween revelers died in South Korea's deadliest crowd surge, a quiet but wrenching reminder of the disaster remained Tuesday: Hundreds of abandoned shoes have been laid out in neat rows in a badminton court in the capital, Seoul. Police have assembled the crumpled tennis shoes, loafers and Chuck Taylors -- part of 1.5 tons of personal objects left by victims and survivors of the tragedy -- in hopes that the owners, or their friends and family, will retrieve them. The deadly crush in the nearby nightlife district Itaewon happened after tens of thousands gathered for Halloween celebrations Saturday evening.China fishing fleet defied U.S. in standoff on the high seas      This summer, as China fired missiles into the sea off Taiwan to protest House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island, a much different kind of geopolitical standoff was taking shape in another corner of the Pacific Ocean. Thousands of miles away, a heavily-armed U.S. Coast Guard cutter sailed up to a fleet of a few hundred Chinese squid-fishing boats not far from Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. Its mission: inspect the vessels for any signs of illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. Boarding ships on the high seas is a perfectly legal if little-used tool available to any sea power as part of the collective effort to protect the oceans' threatened fish stocks.Australian survivor of Seoul crush blames 'mismanagement'      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An Australian survivor of a crowd crush that killed more than 150 partygoers in the South Korean capital of Seoul blamed the huge loss of life on officials' failure to employ effective crowd controls despite anticipating a massive turnout for the Halloween celebrations. Nathan Taverniti, 24, said he's still grappling with emotional shock after one of his friends died during the tragedy Saturday at the nightlife district of Itaewon. The tragedy centered on a narrow, downhill alley running between a dense row of store fronts and the landmark Hamilton Hotel. The path became clogged by a huge wave of partygoers before some fell and toppled over one another like dominoes, according to witnesses, before suffocating to death.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Just a week before midterm election day and with control of Congress at stake, both parties are battling for the win in Pennsylvania's pivotal Senate race, which could determine the balance of power and the nation's agenda moving forward. (Nov. 1)WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least three Republicans running for the U.S. House attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on Jan. 6, 2021, and made their way toward the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection to stop Joe Biden's election.Countless other House Republican candidates are skeptics and deniers of the 2020 election lost by Donald Trump.There are veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, small-business owners and the most geographically, racially and culturally diverse group of Republicans seeking House seats in the modern era -- many of whom, like Trump in 2016, are political newcomers who have never held elected office.All told, the House GOP's Class of 2022 midterm candidates includes a new generation of political outsiders, populists and some extremists who could bring an intensity to Capitol Hill. They would be an untested and potentially unruly majority if Republicans win the House in the Nov. 8 election.\"Trump inspires all of this,\" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was the long-serving spokesperson for former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert.\"There's not a lot of shrinking violets,\" Feehery said about the House Republican candidates. \"Not a lot of people trying to be moderates. They're warriors for their beliefs.\"Republicans are increasingly confident they will win control of the House, confronting Democrats on a widening map. The party in the White House traditionally suffers setbacks in the president's midterm, and Democrats are weighed down by Biden's lagging approval ratings and voter unease over inflation's grip on the economy.In many ways, Republicans are reassembling the Trump coalition with a well-funded but unusual alliance of candidates reflecting his supporters: charismatic Trump-styled media stars, \"America First\" military veterans, women, minorities and what's left of the GOP's traditional conservatives. \"This is going to be the most diverse class of Republicans -- ever -- in every sense of the word,\" said Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida. \"What it means for governing is a big question mark.\"To be sure, some of the House Republican candidates are familiar with elected office or more moderate conservatives who have come up through the ranks of public service -- like the former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, Allan Fung, the son of immigrants who is working to flip a seat opened by a Democratic retirement. But the Republican class is likely to be defined by the Trump-styled newcomers. Retired Navy SEAL Derrick Van Orden  traveled to Washington for Jan. 6 -- though he insists he didn't join the mob attack on the Capitol -- and is considered a rising star poised to defeat Brad Pfaff for an open Wisconsin seat long held by Democrats. Florida's Cory Mills caught attention with a provocative campaign ad in which the former combat veteran, who was also in special operations and went on to be a Trump adviser at the Pentagon, boasts about his company's riot gear that was used on Black Lives Matter protesters and various liberal groups. Karoline Leavitt was not her party's first choice to take on Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in New Hampshire, but Republican voters made the former Trump White House press aide, who questioned the 2020 election results, their nominee. \"She's an election denier who believes the last election was stolen from Donald Trump,\" Pappas said during their recent debate.Leavitt, who recently said during a WMUR event that Biden is, in fact, \"the legitimate president,\" retorted that Pappas voted with Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"100 of the time.\"Unlike the Republican tea party class of 2010 that came to Congress to slash federal budgets or the 2018 Democrats who swept to power on the promise of good governance, the 2022 candidates appear less unified around a common policy agenda. Instead, what many of the Republican recruits do share is Trump's rejection of the establishment and civic norms, an approach much like that of Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, that is transforming the party.Across the country, the GOP candidates reflect Trump's lasting influence and willingness to bring the far-right into the fold -- as seen in Washington state after Joe Kent, a former Green Beret and CIA officer with a harrowing life story, advanced to the November general election over Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 attack.\"Kevin McCarthy and MAGA Republicans have worked overtime to nominate extremist candidates across the country,\" said CJ Warnke, the communications director at House Majority PAC, an outside group aligned with Pelosi. \"We look forward to voters rejecting their out-of-touch policies at the ballot box in November.\"House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who is poised to become House speaker if Republicans gain control, has been instrumental in recruiting the new class that could lift him to power.Learning from the past elections, McCarthy reached deeper for candidates that better reflect the diversity of America, a turnaround from the 2018 election that left about a dozen Republican women and no Black Republicans in the House.Among Republican incumbents and other candidates, there are 28 Black nominees, 33 Hispanics, 13 Asian Americans and three Native Americans, according to the National Republican Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm.McCarthy has maintained a close if sometimes rocky relationship with the former president. In a speech this summer in South Carolina, he championed his far-flung recruits, many of whom have been endorsed by Trump. Since August, McCarthy has visited 34 states in support of Republican candidates and members.\"There's not one place we are not going to play,\" he vowed.Not all those Republicans are party favorites. In fact, leaders tried to keep some of the more extreme Republican candidates off the ballot.More than 11 million was spent during the primary campaigns to prop up favored GOP candidates in Virginia, Texas, California and other states by the Conservative Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with McCarthy.The leadership fund achieved its preferred outcome in most of those races, though there were setbacks. In North Carolina, Trump-styled Sandy Smith -- she tweeted on Jan. 6, \"In DC fighting for Trump! Just marched from the Monument to the Capitol! -- trounced the party favorite.McCarthy campaigned early with JR Majewski, another Republican nominee who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The party has stuck with the Ohio candidate after The Associated Press reported that he misrepresented his military record.During the primaries, Democrats promoted some of the more far-right candidates, helping elevate Trump-backed John Gibbs in Michigan, in a controversial counteroffensive strategy designed to push centrist and independent voters away from Republicans.But Republicans are digging deep into Democratic strongholds of New England, Florida and notably South Texas, where three Latina candidates with tough border control positions reflect a dramatic re-sorting of traditional party allegiances, sounding alarms among Democrats.\"The moment reflects where the party is right now -- Republicans are becoming a more broadly tented party that is making inroads in all types of communities,\" said CLF spokesperson Calvin Moore.\"It's a whole cadre of new voices putting forward their vision of what it means to put the country back on track.\"But recruiting and electing candidates and governing the country are different skill sets. If Republicans win the House, \"they're going to have to teach these guys the value of regular order and the value of working together as a team,\" Feehery said. \"And that's not going to come naturally.\"Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

All Rights Reserved.South Korean police investigated on Monday what caused a crowd surge that killed more than 150 people including 26 foreigners during Halloween festivities in Seoul. (Oct. 31)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean officials admitted responsibility and apologized on Tuesday for failures in preventing and responding to a Halloween crowd surge that killed more than 150 people and left citizens shocked and angry.The government is facing growing public scrutiny over whether the crush Saturday night in Seoul's Itaewon district, a popular nightlife neighborhood, could have been prevented and who should take responsibility for the country's worst disaster in years.National police chief Yoon Hee Keun said an initial investigation found there were many urgent calls from citizens notifying authorities about the potential danger of the crowd gathering in Itaewon. He said police officers who received the calls failed to handle them effectively. \"I feel a heavy responsibility (for the disaster) as the head of one of the related government offices,\" Yoon said in a televised news conference. \"Police will do their best to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.\"Yoon said police have launched an intense internal probe into the officers' handling of the emergency calls and other issues, such as the on-the-spot response to the crowd surge in Itaewon that night.Separately, South Korea's interior minister, emergency office chief, Seoul mayor and the head of a ward office that includes the Itaewon neighborhood all offered public apologies.Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon apologized deeply and wept and briefly halted his news conference as he talked about the parent of a 20-year-old woman who was declared dead earlier in the day.\"When I tried to comfort a person with a daughter hospitalized at the National Medical Center yesterday, they said their daughter would survive and they believed so,\" he said. \"But I heard she passed away this morning. I am sorry that my apology has come late.\"The disaster -- which left at least 156 people dead and 151 others injured -- was concentrated in a narrow downhill alley in Itaewon. Witnesses described people falling on one another, suffering severe breathing difficulties and falling unconscious. They said rescuers and ambulances failed to reach the crammed alleys in time because the entire Itaewon area was packed with slow-moving vehicles and partygoers clad in Halloween costumes.Most of the dead were in their 20s and 30s, and about two-thirds were women.During a Cabinet council meeting Tuesday, President Yoon Suk Yeol acknowledged that South Korea lacks research on crowd management. He called for the use of drones and other high-tech resources to develop an effective crowd control capability, and said the government will soon meet with experts to review national safety rules.The crowd surge is South Korea's deadliest disaster since a 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people and exposed lax safety rules and regulatory failures. Saturday's surge has raised public questions about what South Korea has done since then to prevent human-made disasters. \"My heart is aching a lot as all the victims were like my grandchildren,\" 74-year-old Chung Kil-soon said after paying respects at a mourning station Tuesday. \"People say our country is an advanced country, but I don't think we are truly advanced.\"After the Itaewon disaster, police launched a 475-member task force to find its cause. Senior police officer Nam Gu-Jun told reporters Monday that officers have obtained videos taken by about 50 security cameras in the area and were analyzing video clips posted on social media. Nam said police had also interviewed more than 40 witnesses and survivors so far. Police said they had sent 137 officers to maintain order during the Halloween festivities on Saturday, much more than the 34-90 officers mobilized in 2017, 2018 and 2019 before the pandemic. But some observers questioned whether the 137 officers were enough to handle the estimated 100,00 people gathered Saturday in Itaewon. Adding more questions about the role of police was the fact that they sent 7,000 officers to another part of Seoul earlier Saturday to monitor dueling protests involving tens of thousands of people. Police also acknowledged that the 137 officers dispatched to Itaewon were primarily assigned to monitor crime, with a particular focus on narcotics use, not crowd control.The death toll could rise as officials said that 29 of the injured were in serious condition. The dead included 26 foreign nationals from Iran, China, Russia, the United States, Japan and elsewhere. President Yoon asked officials to provide the same government support to the bereaved families of the foreign victims as for the South Korean dead and injured people. He also thanked many world leaders for sending condolence messages. The Itaewon area, known for its expat-friendly, cosmopolitan atmosphere, is the country's hottest spot for Halloween events and parties, with young South Koreans taking part in costume competitions at bars, clubs and restaurants. Saturday's gathering was the biggest Halloween celebration in the area since the pandemic. Halloween festivities in Itaewon have no official organizers. South Korean police said Monday they don't have any specific procedures for handling incidents such as crowd surges during an event that has no organizers.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)CLEVELAND (AP) -- Joe Burrow barely looked like himself, and it had nothing to do with any kind of silly costume or mask.The Browns made Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals almost unrecognizable.Under pressure from Cleveland's defensive line from the first snap, Burrow had little time to throw and the Bengals were overmatched 32-13 on Monday night by the Browns, who ended a four-game losing streak and stayed unbeaten against Cincinnati's quarterback.The Bengals (4-4) were down 25-0 in the fourth quarter before Burrow threw two touchdown passes that made the score a little less lopsided. The rest of this Halloween night was tilted Cleveland's way.Burrow fell to 0-4 in four career starts against Cleveland, a team the Ohio native hasn't been able to solve.\"They've had our number the last couple of years,\" said Burrow, who finished 25 of 35 for 232 yards and one interception. \"They always play well against us, they have real good players in defense and are really well coached.\"Burrow was sacked five times, and came close to being thrown down several others.It started out OK for the Bengals, who drove into Cleveland territory on their first possession before Burrow's pass was tipped by Browns All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett and intercepted by cornerback A.J. Green.The next time Cincinnati got the ball, Garrett, who came to FirstEnergy Stadium dressed as Vecna, the scary villain in the TV series \"Stranger Things,\" sacked Burrow, who was under major duress all night.\"He's one of the elite of the elite in the game,\" Burrow said of Garrett. \"He's always going to make plays, like he did tonight.\"Nothing went for the right the Bengals, who were outrushed 172-36.Cincinnati's defense, which didn't give up a second-half touchdown in its first seven games, allowed three in the second half -- on consecutive drives.Kicker Evan McPherson missed a 47-yard field goal attempt, running back Joe Mixon had just 27 yard on eight carries and Cincinnati's offense was lacking its best deep threat with wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase out with a hip injury.Without Chase, Burrow didn't have his favorite target and a player capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. Chase is expected to miss several weeks, and the Bengals need to quickly figure out how to cope without him.\"Ja'Marr is going to do what he needs to do to get back,\" Burrow said. \"Any time that guy goes down, it's going to have an effect.\"Bengals coach Zac Taylor didn't have any immediate answers for what went wrong. There's plenty for him and his staff to fix and little time to do it with a game against Carolina on Sunday.\"The game was 25-0 before you even know it,\" Taylor said. \"We just didn't come back. The worst thing to do against the Cleveland Browns is to give them a two, three score lead with their running game and their pass rush.\"We flush this one away quickly and get ready for Carolina.\"The Bengals were out of rhythm from the outset. Some of that was because of Cleveland's defense and some of it was Cincinnati failing to execute.\"We just weren't playing collectively,\" said wide receiver Tyler Boyd, who caught a 13-yard TD in the fourth. \"We couldn't get into that rhythm, couldn't get that big catch to get the offense going and we needed to protect Joe better.\"The Bengals fell to 0-3 in the AFC North, but Burrow isn't worried.\"We're not panicking,\" he said. \"We know what went wrong in each game. We have to go back and watch the film, make our corrections in this one like we always have and come back out firing next week.\"NOTES: CB Chidobe Awuzie left the stadium on crutches and his right knee immobilized. Taylor said the injury appears to be severe. ... CB Tre Flowers (hamstring) left in the fourth quarter and didn't return. ... CB Eli Apple was inactive due to a hamstring injury. ...

(AP Photo/Asanka Brendon Ratnayake)MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- French-bred six-year-old Gold Trip won the 162nd running of the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday ahead of Emissary and High Emocean over 3,200 meters in Australia's most famous horse race.One of five runners for co-trainers Ciaron Maher and David Eustace in the race, Gold Trip was ridden by Mark Zahra and won by a length and a half.More than 80,000 spectators packed Flemington race track under mostly rainy and cloudy conditions. It was the first time the grandstand held unlimited fans since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Favorite and English stayer Deauville Legend was fourth, and Realm of Flowers finished fifth.From barrier 13, Zahra had Gold Trip settled among the back markers off a strong start by Serpentine. The race changed complexion about 900 meters from the finish when Tim Clark, riding Knights Order, picked up the pace.Gold Trip claimed the lead just before the 300-meter mark, kicking clear before holding off a spirited charge from Emissary while High Emocean -- also from the Maher and Eustace stable -- came home late for third.\"I feel like crying. It's unbelievable. What a day,\" Zahra said.\"He's a horse that when you go, you don't give him a chance to think about it. I was hoping no one would come near him. It's just elation when I crossed the line.\"Zahra said he hoped Gold Trip could ambush his rivals late in the race.\"I literally thought I'm a bit far back here but my one plan was not to be too close because I thought if I used fuel early I'd be weak late,\" Zahra said. \"As they jammed up, I got to travel up and up and I thought I'm still traveling so good here.\"I waited and waited and with the horse, I've always said when you go you've got to go.\"There were 22 horses in the field after two late scratches.The race day was hit by two groups of protesters. Animal rights activists held signs calling for an end to the \"archaic\" sport of horse racing. The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses urged people to say \"Nup to the Cup\", saying 139 racehorses died on Australian tracks in the past racing year.In an unrelated incident, footage of an unidentified person allegedly breaking into the course ahead of the race surfaced. A video posted on social media appears to show the person pouring oil on a grassy area to protest \"toxic\" racing industry, but the track was not damaged.Police also dealt with climate protesters outside the gates of the track, but there were no reports of arrests.More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.This image released by the BBC shows London-based reporter Marianna Spring, who illustrated how disinformation spreads on sites like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok despite efforts to stop it, and how that impacts American politics. (Robert Timothy/BBC via AP)NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry, a 71-year-old retired insurance broker and Donald Trump fan from Alabama, wouldn't be likely to run into the liberal Emma, a 25-year-old graphic designer from New York City, on social media -- even if they were both real.Each is a figment of BBC reporter Marianna Spring's imagination. She created five fake Americans and opened social media accounts for them, part of an attempt to illustrate how disinformation spreads on sites like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok despite efforts to stop it, and how that impacts American politics.That's also left Spring and the BBC vulnerable to charges that the project is ethically suspect in using false information to uncover false information.\"We're doing it with very good intentions because it's important to understand what is going on,\" Spring said. In the world of disinformation, \"the U.S. is the key battleground,\" she said.Spring's reporting has appeared on BBC's newscasts and website, as well as the weekly podcast \"Americast,\" the British view of news from the United States. She began the project in August with the midterm election campaign in mind but hopes to keep it going through 2024.Spring worked with the Pew Research Center in the U.S. to set up five archetypes, although the center was not involved in how to use them. Besides the very conservative Larry and very liberal Emma, there's Britney, a more populist conservative from Texas; Gabriela, a largely apolitical independent from Miami; and Michael, a Black teacher from Milwaukee who's a moderate Democrat.With computer-generated photos, she set up accounts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The accounts are passive, meaning her \"people\" don't have friends or make public comments.Spring, who uses five different phones labeled with each name, tends to the accounts to fill out their \"personalities.\" For instance, Emma is a lesbian who follows LGBTQ groups, is an atheist, takes an active interest in women's issues and abortion rights, supports the legalization of marijuana and follows The New York Times and NPR.These \"traits\" are the bait, essentially, to see how the social media companies' algorithms kick in and what material is sent their way.Through what she followed and liked, Britney was revealed as anti-vax and critical of big business, so she has been sent into several rabbit holes, Spring said. The account has received material, some with violent rhetoric, from groups falsely claiming Donald Trump won the 2020 election. She's also been invited to join in with people who claim the Mar-a-Lago raid was \"proof\" Trump won and the state was out to get him, and groups that support conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.Despite efforts by social media companies to combat disinformation, Spring said there's still a considerable amount getting through, mostly from a far-right perspective.Gabriela, the non-aligned Latina mom who's mostly expressed interest in music, fashion and how to save money while shopping, doesn't follow political groups. But it's far more likely that Republican-aligned material will show up in her feed.\"The best thing you can do is understand how this works,\" Spring said. \"It makes us more aware of how we're being targeted.\"Most major social media companies prohibit impersonator accounts. Violators can be kicked off for creating them, although many evade the rules.Journalists have used several approaches to probe how the tech giants operate. For a story last year, the Wall Street Journal created more than 100 automated accounts to see how TikTok steered users in different directions. The nonprofit newsroom the Markup set up a panel of 1,200 people who agreed to have their web browsers studied for details on how Facebook and YouTube operated.\"My job is to investigate misinformation and I'm setting up fake accounts,\" Spring said. \"The irony is not lost on me.\"She's obviously creative, said Aly Colon, a journalism ethics professor at Washington  Lee University. But what Spring called ironic disturbs him and other experts who believe there are above-board ways to report on this issue.\"By creating these false identities, she violates what I believe is a fairly clear ethical standard in journalism,\" said Bob Steele, retired ethics expert for the Poynter Institute. \"We should not pretend that we are someone other than ourselves, with very few exceptions.\"Spring said she believes the level of public interest in how these social media companies operate outweighs the deception involved.The BBC said the investigation was created in accordance with its strict editorial guidelines.\"We take ethics extremely seriously and numerous processes are in place to ensure that our activity does not affect anyone else,\" the network said. \"Our coverage is transparent and clearly states that the investigation does not offer exhaustive insight into what every U.S. voter could be seeing on social media, but instead provides a snapshot of the important issues associated with the spread of online disinformation.\"The BBC experiment can be valuable, but only shows part of how algorithms work, a mystery that largely evades people outside of the tech companies, said Samuel Woolley, director of the propaganda research lab in the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas.Algorithms also take cues from comments that people make on social media or in their interactions with friends -- both things that BBC's fake Americans don't do, he said.\"It's like a journalist's version of a field experiment,\" Woolley said. \"It's running an experiment on a system but it's pretty limited in its rigor.\"From Spring's perspective, if you want to see how an influence operation works, \"you need to be on the front lines.\"Since launching the five accounts, Spring said she logs on every few days to update each of them and see what they're being fed.\"I try to make it as realistic as possible,\" she said. \"I have these five personalities that I have to inhabit at any given time.\"This story was first published on Nov. 1, 2022, and updated on Nov. 4, 2022, to add that the Pew Research Center was not involved in how five archetypes of fake Americans were used.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Kentucky voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to declare it doesn't protect the right to an abortion. (Ryan C. Hermens/Lexington Herald-Leader via AP, File)LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Karen Roper was so shaken by the demise of Roe v. Wade that she joined the abortion-rights struggle in Kentucky, where the future of abortion access could hinge on a constitutional question before voters this election. Roper is part of a volunteer network canvassing neighborhoods seeking votes against the Nov. 8 ballot proposal. Kentucky voters are being asked to decide whether to amend the state constitution to declare outright that it doesn't protect the right to an abortion.The question reads: \"To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"A 55-year-old mother of two daughters, Roper spent several October weekends knocking on doors in a central Kentucky town.\"This issue is really beyond a candidate and it's beyond a political party,\" she said. \"I felt like this was more important than even any candidate I might care about.\"Fervor is running high on both sides. Abortion opponents see the measure as a way to end any constitutional protections for abortion in Kentucky -- perhaps settling the long legal fight for good.\"This is a pivotal moment in Kentucky's history,\" said Addia Wuchner, chairwoman of the pro-amendment Yes for Life Alliance.Currently, abortions are mostly on hold in Kentucky amid sparring over the constitutionality of a near-total abortion ban trigger law. Approved by lawmakers in 2019, the ban took effect after Roe was overturned. Now the ballot measure has intensified debate, with donations pouring in, politicians speaking out and advocates on both sides accusing the opposition of misleading voters.Meanwhile, abortion-rights supporters have been encouraged by developments this summer in another conservative state, Kansas, where voters rejected a ballot measure that would have changed that state's constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions.\"In a very real sense, what is at stake is any future path to restoring access to legal abortion in the commonwealth,\" said Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access, an abortion-rights coalition.Kentucky's constitutional battle has been brewing since the Republican-dominated legislature reserved a spot last year for the abortion measure this election cycle. The stakes are high. In June, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, and consequently abortions are on pause in Kentucky -- with a narrow exception -- as the state's highest court reviews the law that halted the procedures.University of Louisville student Helene Senn, part of the door-knocking campaign backing the amendment, said abortion opponents can't let this opportunity \"slip through our hands.\" The Roe decision gave her added motivation. \"I knew there was a greater opportunity to make such a big impact in our state,\" said Senn, 20. Abortion-rights supporters are using the ban in seeking to broaden opposition to the amendment. That law called for the immediate end to almost all abortions once Roe was overturned, except for abortions to save a pregnant woman's life or to prevent disabling injury. There are no exceptions for rape or incest victims.\"For a lot of people, that is a shocking thing to hear ... even people who really have complicated feelings about abortion do think that there should be exceptions,\" Sweet said. Abortion opponents say approval of the amendment would ensure abortion policy comes from the legislature -- where they say it belongs -- not the courts.\"Practically speaking, this ... will keep state judges in their lane of interpreting the law and not inventing new laws and new rights that the constitution does not speak of,\" said Republican state Rep. Nancy Tate, a leading anti-abortion voice.The trigger law is under challenge by the two abortion clinics that remain in Kentucky -- both in Louisville, the state's largest city. The lawsuit said women were being \"forced to remain pregnant against their will\" in violation of the state's constitution. Kentucky's Supreme Court has kept the ban in place while reviewing the case, poised to hear arguments after the election. The suit also challenges another state law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has branded the trigger law as extreme, said the amendment vote will weigh heavily on the court case.\"There's no question that this constitutional amendment will keep that trigger law in effect if it passes,\" said Beshear. \"If it fails, then the Kentucky Supreme Court is going to look at that trigger law and determine if it's constitutional.\" The abortion amendment has overshadowed other campaigns in a state where the GOP won total control of the legislature in 2016.Abortion-rights supporters see the measure as a chance to reverse the anti-abortion momentum that led to several lawmaker-approved restrictions and conditions on abortion, many prompting court challenges. They say the legislature's hardline stand on abortion is why constitutional protections are necessary.Abortion opponents say the anti-abortion bills passed in recent years reflect the will of Kentuckians.\"Kentuckians value life. They value the life of the unborn child,\" said Wuchner, an ex-lawmaker and executive director of Kentucky Right to Life.Tate said the legislature can discuss abortion legislation \"any time that it is in session.\" That could include bills to expand exceptions to the abortion ban, where disagreement among Republicans would likely surface.\"I don't support exceptions,\" Republican state Sen. Whitney Westerfield said at a recent gathering of lawmakers against abortion. \"God made each of us in his image. He knew us before he formed us in the womb. This is a religious and faith question for me.\"Associated Press Writer Dylan Lovan contributed to his report from Louisville, Kentucky.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Families of the 17 children and staff members Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz murdered concluded their first day of confronting him in court. (Nov. 1)FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Families of the 17 children and staff members Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz murdered cursed him to hell, wished him a painful death and called him a coward Tuesday as they got their one chance to address him directly before he is sentenced to life in prison. For hours, parents, wives, siblings, children and some of the 17 Cruz also wounded at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine's Day 2018 stood 20 feet (6 meters) from him. They looked the shackled killer in the eye and gave vehement, angry and sometimes tearful statements. Most decried that his jury voted 9-3 for death but did not reach the unanimity required under state law for that sentence to be imposed. Cruz, 24, stared back at them, dressed in a bright red jail jumpsuit, showing no emotion behind a COVID-19 face mask. The two-day hearing will conclude Wednesday when Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer formally sentences him to life without parole.\"This creature has no redeemable value,\" said Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son Alex died when he was shot through a classroom window. Speaking at Cruz but refusing to say his name, he said he hopes \"other prisoners you will encounter in your new life will inflict that pain upon you, hopefully 17 times over again, until you are screaming for mercy, just like your victims.\"Schachter said that it was his birthday and that when he blew out his cake's candles Tuesday night, he would wish Cruz a painful death -- and would every year until it happens.Some of the families verbally attacked Cruz's public defenders, accusing them of misleading the jurors who voted for a life sentence into believing his birth mother's excessive drinking had left him brain damaged and unable to control himself. Some hoped that their consciences would haunt them forever and would experience the pain they have felt, with at least one parent mentioning the attorneys' children.\"The legal system should protect and impart justice, justice, justice,\" Patricia Oliver said, leaning over the lectern toward the defense attorneys and accusing them of \"shameful, despicable behavior.\" Cruz wounded her 17-year-old son Joaquin in the leg and then tracked him into a bathroom alcove. There, Cruz fatally shot her son in the head with his AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle as he raised his hand to protect himself.\"If this, the worst mass shooting to go to trial, does not deserve the death penalty, what does?\" she said. Nine other U.S. gunmen who killed at least 17 people took their own lives or were killed by police. The suspect in the 2019 deaths of 23 people at a Walmart in Texas is awaiting trial. Lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill eventually asked Judge Scherer to stop the families from attacking her and her colleagues directly, saying they had worked within the parameters of Cruz's constitutional rights in defending him.\"I did my job, and every member of this team did our job, and we should not personally be attacked for that, nor should our children,\" McNeill said, drawing a murmur from where the families sat.Prosecutor Carolyn McCann told Scherer that the victims have the right under state law and the Constitution to \"express themselves and be heard.\"When McNeill tried to respond to McCann, telling the judge she knew the parents were violating court decorum, Scherer stopped her. The two have had a testy and sometimes hostile relationship since pretrial hearings.\"Stop suggesting that I know that something is improper,\" Scherer said, saying she had heard enough. She took no action against the families. The argument resumed after lunch, with Scherer yelling at and ejecting one of McNeill's assistants. The assistant had asserted that the judge would be more concerned about the statements if the parents had mentioned Scherer's own children.Cruz's attorneys say he is not expected to speak. He apologized in court last year after pleading guilty to the murders and attempted murders, but families told reporters they found the apology aimed at garnering sympathy. He fired 140 shots during his seven-minute attack, which he had planned for seven months.That plea set the stage for a three-month penalty trial that ended Oct. 13 with the jury failing to reach unanimity. Jurors said those voting for life believed Cruz is mentally ill and should be spared.That led to the current hearing and the raw emotions expressed by the families and surviving victims. This is just some of what they said to Cruz:-- \"You stole him from us, and you did not receive the justice that you deserved,\" said Debra Hixon, whose husband, athletic director Chris Hixon, died running at Cruz to stop him. Cruz shot him again after he fell wounded to the ground. \"You'll be sent to jail, you'll begin your punishment, you'll be a number, and for me you will cease to exist.\"-- \"We hope that you, the monster who did this to our son, endure a painful existence in your remaining days,\" said Eric Wikander, the father of student Ben Wikander, who has undergone seven surgeries to repair his wounds.-- \"Because of you, I check for all exits wherever I am,\" said teacher Stacey Lippel, who was wounded. \"Because of you, I think of the worst-case scenario for myself and my family. Because of you, I will never feel safe again. I have no forgiveness in my heart for you.\"This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the first name of the lead defense attorney to Melisa, instead of Melissa.Associated Press writer Freida Frisaro in Miami contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to edge toward election victory on Wednesday, with nearly two-thirds of ballots showing that he and his ultranationalist and religious allies are poised to achieve a stable majority in the country's parliament.Votes were still being counted and results were not final. But if preliminary indications were correct, Israel was likely headed to one of its most right-wing governments, bolstered by a strong showing from the ultranationalist Religious Zionism party, whose members use inflammatory anti-Arab and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.The initial results pointed to a continued rightward shift in the Israeli electorate, further dimming hopes for peace with the Palestinians and setting the stage for possible conflict with the Biden administration and Israel's supporters in the U.S.Tuesday's election was Israel's fifth in less than four years, with all of them focused largely on Netanyahu's fitness to govern. On trial for a slew of corruption charges, Netanyahu is seen by supporters as the victim of a witch hunt and vilified by opponents as a crook and threat to democracy.Elections officials worked through the night tallying votes and by early Wednesday, some 62 of the ballots had been counted. The vote, like past elections, was tight but indications showed Netanyahu was headed back to premiership with a firm majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament.If Netanyahu's allies emerge victorious, it could still take weeks of negotiations for a coalition government to be formed. Continued deadlock and a new round of elections are also a possibility.Speaking in Jerusalem in the middle of the night, Netanyahu asked his supporters to have patience and said his Likud Party was \"on the verge of a very big victory.\"Perhaps fearing that Arab voters would deny him victory, Netanyahu tweeted allegations of violence and vote tampering at Arab polling stations. He provided no evidence, and the country's nonpartisan Central Elections Committee dismissed the \"baseless rumors.\"Netanyahu later said he was \"asking for total electoral purity because that's the basis of democracy.\"Arabs make up some 20 of Israel's population and have been a key factor in blocking Netanyahu in recent elections. But this time around their vote was split among three different factions, each of which was at risk of falling below the threshold, which would mean those votes were wasted.Netanyahu was Israel's longest-serving prime minister, governing for 12 consecutive years - and 15 years altogether - before he was ousted last year by a diverse coalition led by the centrist Yair Lapid.But the coalition that Lapid cobbled together, which included the first Arab party ever to join a government, was ravaged by infighting and collapsed after just one year in power. Those parties were poised to capture just 54 seats, according to the polls.Lapid, addressing supporters early Wednesday, insisted that the race was not decided.\"Until the last envelope is counted, nothing is over and nothing is final,\" he said.The night's strongest showing was by far-right lawmaker Itamar Ben-Gvir's Religious Zionism, which emerged as the third-largest party. At an all-male campaign gathering in Jerusalem, religious men wearing Jewish skullcaps and waving Israeli flags danced in celebration.Ben-Gvir is a disciple of a racist rabbi, Meir Kahane, who was banned from parliament and whose Kach party was branded a terrorist group by the United States before he was assassinated in New York in 1990.Kahane's agenda called for banning intermarriage between Arabs and Jews, stripping Arabs of Israeli citizenship and expelling large numbers of Palestinians.But while Kahane was seen as a pariah, Ben-Gvir is one of Israel's most popular politicians, thanks to his frequent media appearances, cheerful demeanor, knack for deflecting criticism and calls for a harder line against Palestinians at a time of heavy fighting in the occupied West Bank. Young ultra-Orthodox men are among his strongest supporters.Ben-Gvir lives in the hard-line West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and is a strong proponent of settlement construction. He has described Arab colleagues in parliament as \"terrorists,\" called for deporting those who are \"disloyal\" and recently brandished a handgun in a tense Palestinian neighborhood of Jerusalem as he called on police to shoot Palestinian stone-throwers.At the celebration, Ben-Gvir's supporters chanted \"Death to terrorists.\"\"We want to make a total separation between those who are loyal to the state of Israel -- and we don't have any problem with them -- and those who undermine our dear country,\" he said.Muhammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, said the rise of Israel's far right was \"a natural result of the growing manifestations of extremism and racism in Israeli society.\"If the Netanyahu alliance ends up controlling a majority, Ben-Gvir and his party leader, Bezalel Smotrich, are sure to drive a hard bargain. Ben-Gvir has said he will demand the Cabinet post overseeing Israel's police force.The pair have also said they will seek legal reforms aimed at weakening the independence of the judiciary and giving parliament power to override court decisions they don't like. That could clear the way for the dismissal of criminal charges against Netanyahu. Smotrich and other members of the party have also made repeated anti-LGBTQ comments.Such positions could put a future Netanyahu government on a collision course with the Biden administration, which supports a two-state solution with the Palestinians. It could also alienate Israeli allies in the U.S., particularly the predominantly liberal Jewish American community.\"Ben-Gvir is one of the most radical politicians in Israeli history. If he comes with so much political power, this will pose a major headache for Mr. Netanyahu,\" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank.He said Netanyahu, if asked to form the next government, might try to seek other potential coalition partners instead. With Netanyahu's opponents vowing never to sit in a government with him, that could be a difficult task.In Israel, voters vote for parties, not individual politicians. No party has ever won a majority on its own, and coalition-building is necessary to govern.The Likud Party was projected to be the largest, with some 31 seats in parliament, followed by Lapid's Yesh Atid, with 22 to 24 seats.Lapid was the mastermind of the coalition that turned Netanyahu into the opposition leader.The coalition was made up of nationalists who oppose Palestinian statehood, dovish parties that seek a peace agreement and -- for the first time in the country's history -- a small Arab Islamist party. The groups were united over their distaste for Netanyahu.But that coalition collapsed this spring because of infighting.The centrist Lapid, a former author and broadcaster who became premier as part of a power-sharing agreement, has portrayed himself as an honest and scandal-free change from the polarizing Netanyahu.In his short term as caretaker leader, Lapid welcomed President Joe Biden on a visit to Israel, led the country in a brief military operation against Gaza militants and signed a diplomatic agreement with Lebanon setting a maritime boundary between the enemy nations.Associated Press reporters Ilan Ben Zion and Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, and Joseph Krauss in Ottawa, Ontario contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

United forward Taxi Fountas will not be disciplined by Major League Soccer after the league said it found credible an allegation he used racially abusive language toward Miami defender Aime Mabika during a match on Sept. 18 but could not find corroborating evidence. The league said in a statement Monday that it \"could not independently verify the allegation\" but it \"did not find credible Fountas' claim, made during interviews conducted as part of this investigation, that he said nothing in that moment -- discriminatory or otherwise.\"\"Video of the incident clearly shows Mabika suddenly reacting to something he believed he heard from Fountas,\" the league said. \"MLS was unable to confirm independently, through additional eyewitness accounts, video footage or audio recordings, what Fountas said in that moment, as has been the league's long-standing practice in determining player discipline for these types of allegations.\"Fontas agreed to remain away from the team during its final two games on Oct. 1 and Oct. 9. The league said he is eligible to play for D.C. next season.\"MLS plans to examine its policies and practices as they relate to allegations of abusive and discriminatory language and is committed to working with all of the stakeholders during this offseason,\" the league said.Separately, MLS fined D.C. United 25,000 for failure to comply fully with the league's diversity hiring policy when Wayne Rooney replaced Hernan Losada as coach in July. The league said its policy requires \"the finalist pool includes two or more candidates from underrepresented groups, whereby at least one candidate must be either Black or African-American.\"MLS said D.C. met with two qualifying candidates from underrepresented groups, but one could not be considered a \"finalist pool\" interview because the team learned during the interview that the individual was not available to pursue the job.\"The club remained obligated to bring an additional candidate from an underrepresented group into the finalist pool' or request a waiver from MLS detailing the extenuating circumstances,\" the league said.More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Robert Friedman, owner of a Steinway grand piano once owned by Thomas Edison, is looking for a home for the historical artifact. Friedman purchased the piano last year and says he was surprised by the toothy signatures left by the famed inventor. (Nov. 1) (AP video by: Michael Hill)WOODSTOCK, N.Y. (AP) -- Hard of hearing, Thomas Edison found a unique way to appreciate piano music. As someone played, the great inventor would lean in close to the instrument, right above the keys, and he'd bite the piano. Pressing his teeth into the wood of phonographs and pianos helped Edison experience the vibrations in his skull. Or in his own words, it allowed him to \"hear through my teeth.\"Robert Friedman recently showed off marks on a Steinway grand piano once owned by Edison -- a cluster of shallow indentations roughing up the black lacquer above the keyboard. Friedman, who buys and sells Steinways, purchased the piano last year and says he was surprised by the toothy signatures left by the inventor of the phonograph. He's now looking for the right home for the novel historical artifact. \"I believe that it belongs somewhere where many, many, many people can see it,\" Friedman said.Edison bought the Model \"B\" Ebony from Steinway  Sons in 1890 for 725. Paperwork with the sale includes the handwritten notation \"office furniture,\" indicating it was sent to his lab in New Jersey. The piano \"for some reason unknown to me it gives better results than any so far tried,\" Edison wrote the company. \"Please send bill with lowest price.\"Edison invented the phonograph in 1877. When he bought the piano 13 years later, he was experimenting with sound recording. Edison owned the instrument for decades, so it's possible it was used in early recordings.So did Edison's teeth make those marks? There's no known old black-and-white photo of Edison chomping this piano to prove it. But he was known to bite into phonographs and pianos to help him experience music as his hearing faded. His daughter once recalled a guest weeping at the sight of Edison clamped on to a piano as someone played it.\"I hear through my teeth, and through my skull,\" said Edison, as quoted in Edmund Morris' 2019 biography. \"I bite my teeth into the wood and then I get it good and strong.\"The formulation is simple for Friedman: Those are tooth marks, and who else would have bit the piano? \"I've probably had my hands on a few thousand Steinways in the last 50 years,\" Friedman said. \"I've never seen that anywhere.\"Friedman bought the piano for about 45,000, sight unseen, in early January 2021 as part of an estate sale on Long Island. Friedman didn't notice the marks at first. His friend Charles Frommer, a musician and recording history enthusiast, came to Friedman's house in New York's Hudson Valley to tune the piano, noticed the indentations and told him \"those are Edison's bite marks.\"Friedman, who calls himself the Steinway hunter, finds and buys the high-end pianos from people and then sells them, usually to dealers or rebuilders. But this one is more complicated. Given this piano's historic association, he doesn't want it to go back into private hands. He has yet to find an appropriate historic site that would buy the piano, which he is offering for what it cost him to purchase, ship and recondition it.The Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey, passed up a chance to buy the piano from its previous owner in 2020 for several reasons, including limited space, cost and the fact that some original interior parts were replaced since Edison owned it, museum curator Jerry Fabris said in an email.Friedman is undeterred and still looking for a home. A documentary also is possible, or having the piano recorded for a virtual instrument sample library. In the meantime, the piano has been featured at fundraisers for the Ulster County Jewish Federation at the home of friends in Woodstock who housed the instrument until recently.And, yes Edison's listening technique has been tested on the piano. Not wanting to mark up the instrument any further, Frommer said they tried it with wooden shims placed on the piano.\"We were able to replicate the effect,\" Frommer said. \"And yeah, you do hear it in your skull.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With Kawhi Leonard's return nowhere in sight, Paul George is putting pressure on himself to carry the Los Angeles Clippers and their high expectations.Despite turnovers down the stretch, George came up with two huge baskets to help the Clippers edge the Houston Rockets 95-93 on Monday night and snap a four-game losing streak.\"We're not playing the heavyweights right now,\" George said. \"The way we were losing these games, it was embarrassing. We've got to start to play better.\"The Clippers (3-4) again were without Leonard and John Wall. Leonard missed his fifth game and Wall sat out his second, both because of knee injury management.\"I take full responsibility for us and our record right now,\" George said. \"Regardless of who's in the lineup or who's not, I'm more than capable of going out and performing.\"George hit a go-ahead jumper with six seconds remaining, finishing with 35 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Ivica Zubac added 16 points and 12 rebounds. He teamed with George to score 14 of the Clippers' 22 points in the fourth quarter, when they played a two-man pick and roll.\"That's one of our best plays with me and PG doing pick and rolls together,\" Zubac said. \"We couldn't make any shots but we attacked the paint.\"K.J. Martin scored 23 points off the bench to lead the Rockets (1-8), who dropped their fourth in a row.George's 3-pointer tied the game 93-all with 39 seconds remaining. That got fans on their feet for the final seconds. George stole the ball from former Clipper Eric Gordon. After another timeout, Reggie Jackson inbounded to George, who hit a jumper that gave the Clippers their first lead of the fourth quarter.Gordon's shot missed at the buzzer and he gestured to indicate he thought he'd been fouled.\"We're a group that fights,\" Houston coach Stephen Silas said. \"We executed pretty good down the stretch.\"George had three costly turnovers in the final minutes after hitting a 3-pointer that drew the Clippers within two earlier in the fourth. His first led to a dunk by Kevin Porter Jr. After George's second turnover, he got called for an offensive foul.\"Bad turnovers, bad possessions,\" George said, ticking off some of the Clippers' issues. \"We're not shooting the ball well. That's going to come. Tonight, defensively, was a step in the right direction.\"George fed Zubac for a dunk that again got the Clippers within two. But Jalen Green answered with a basket to keep Houston ahead.Martin, who finished four points off his career high, got hot late in the third and early in the fourth. Tari Eason and Martin combined to score 11 points in a row to put Houston back in front, 76-71, late in the third.Martin had Houston's first five points of the fourth before missing two free throws with the Rockets clinging to a two-point lead.The teams traded narrow leads in the third, when George scored 12 points.Rockets: Jae'Sean Tate reaggravated the ankle injury that forced him to miss the season's first four games. He's day-to-day and will be re-evaluated in Houston. Clippers: Robert Covington remains in the NBA's health and safety protocols. ... Los Angeles has won seven of its last eight against the Rockets.Leonard won't be joining the Clippers for their quick two-game trip to Texas this week.\"He's frustrated. He wants to be out on the floor,\" coach Tyronn Lue said. \"Then not being on the floor, now you can't travel.

Australia's central bank boosted its benchmark interest rate for a seventh consecutive month to a nine-year high of 2.85 percent. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia's central bank boosted its benchmark interest rate on Tuesday for a seventh consecutive month to a nine-year high of 2.85.The Reserve Bank of Australia's decided on a second consecutive quarter-percentage-point rise in the cash rate at its latest monthly board meeting following four consecutive half-percentage-point hikes.When the bank lifted the rate by a quarter percentage point in May, it was Australia's first rate hike in more than 11 years. The cash rate is now at its highest point since May 2013, when the bank cut the rate from 3 to 2.75.Reserve Bank Gov. Philip Lowe said in a statement \"inflation in Australia is too high,\" and his board \"expects to increase interest rates further over the period ahead.\"The bank \"remains resolute in its determination to return inflation\" to a target band of 2 to 3 by raising the cost of money, Lowe said.Inflation rose from an annual rate of 6.1 in the June quarter to 7.3 in the September quarter.The Treasury Department forecast last week that inflation would peak at 7.75 before the end of the year. But the bank expected a peak of \"around 8.\"Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the rate hike reaffirmed his government's decision to restrain spending in its economic plan for the current fiscal year which he released last week in the annual budget.\"As today's decision has shown, inflation is the No. 1 challenge in our economy. It's the No. 1 focus of the government. It's the No. 1 focus when it comes to the budget that we handed down last week,\" Chalmers told reporters.Lowe said Australia's economy was \"continuing to grow solidly.\"Treasury documents released last week forecast the economy would grow 3.25 in the current fiscal year that began on July 1 before plummeting to 1.5 in 2023-24 as rising interest rates hit consumer spending. Growth is then forecast to creep up to 2.25 in 2024-25 and to 2.5 the following year.Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the nation's largest business group, warned the bank against pushing the economy into recession.\"We have to be careful. I think we can't have a situation where it's tightened too rapidly,\" McKellar told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\"If they squeeze the life out of the economy, then really the damage is going to be quite significant and we don't want to end up with that outcome,\" he added.

(Nov. 1)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An Australian survivor of a crowd crush that killed more than 150 partygoers in the South Korean capital of Seoul blamed the huge loss of life on officials' failure to employ effective crowd controls despite anticipating a massive turnout for the Halloween celebrations.Nathan Taverniti, 24, said he's still grappling with emotional shock after one of his friends died during the tragedy Saturday at the nightlife district of Itaewon. The tragedy centered on a narrow, downhill alley running between a dense row of store fronts and the landmark Hamilton Hotel. The path became clogged by a huge wave of partygoers before some fell and toppled over one another like dominoes, according to witnesses, before suffocating to death.An estimated 100,000 partygoers flocked to Itaewon for the Halloween celebrations over the weekend, and some experts say it should have been an obvious decision for authorities to temporarily block some of the neighborhood's notoriously narrow lanes and hills. \"If the government knows that there were going to be that many people there, and there is going to be road blockages, there should be enough police and emergency services already there on standby,\" Taverniti said. Stuck in a huge crowd, Taverniti said he didn't sense that something terrible would happen until some women near him apparently slipped and fell down, and people nearby tried to help them back up. By that time, he could no longer seen where his three friends were. \"All of a sudden more people started falling ... there were just too many people,\" he said. He said he thought he saw some of his friends' hands among the people who were piling up. He tried to grab them, but had to let go after being crushed by the enormous weight of other people who were losing balance. He said he heard \"lots of people screaming.\" Taverniti said he shouted to the bars and clubs to open their doors to let some people in to ease the crowd, but that nobody listened. He said several police officers arrived about half an hour later and people in the crowd helped pull out those who were injured before more officers arrived later. He later found one of his friends among the rows of unconscious bodies laid out in the pavement. Tavernit was able to locate his two other friends being treated at hospitals. He says he plans to stay in Seoul for a bit longer to ensure the steady recovery of his hospitalized friends.\"I believe 100 that this incident is a result of the government's mismanagement and the lack of ability because I have known that Halloween event has always been this big in Itaewon,\" he said. \"This year there was clearly not enough police presence.\"AP writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to the report.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Former U.S. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates speaks at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass., May 24, 2017. An independent investigation into the scandals that erupted in the National Women's Soccer League last season showed that emotional abuse and sexual misconduct was systemic in the sport, impacting multiple teams, coaches and players. \"Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women's soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players,\" former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates wrote in her report for U.S. Soccer, which was released on Monday, Oct. 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)CHICAGO (AP) -- Mana Shim, a former player for the National Women's Soccer League and the U.S. under-23 national team, will chair the U.S. Soccer Federation's taskforce to prevent the abuse and harassment of women that was found to be systemic in the sport.The USSF created a participant safety taskforce following a report issued Oct. 3 by former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates.\"There's still so much that needs to be done when it comes to changing the culture of soccer in this country,\" Shim said in a statement Monday. \"I believe we have an opportunity in this moment to protect players and set a new standard for all sports. We don't have any time to waste.\"Five of 10 coaches in the NWSL in 2021 were fired or stepped down amid allegations of misconduct, and NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird resigned.\"Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women's soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players,\" Yates wrote.\"For far too long, leaders across the soccer ecosystem -- including at U.S. Soccer -- have not taken responsibility for protecting players,\" Shim said. \"I believe in the capacity for change. As leader of the taskforce, I am committed to ensuring not only that Yates's recommendations are implemented, but that we push beyond them. We need to find the root causes of our sport's systemic failures and take action at every level -- from the youth game to the professional game.\"Shim, 31, was a midfielder for the Portland Thorns (2013-17) and Houston Dash (2018-19) and also played for Japan's Iga Kunoichi in 2015 and Sweden's Vaxjo in 2017. She made four appearances for the U.S. under-23 team in 2012.Yates recommended disclosure of termination and discipline by teams to the USSF and the NWSL, a database of complaints and findings, a public listing of discipline, the elimination of nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements and annual recertification of coaches and attestation to the accuracy of background information.She also recommended screening of licensed coaches, limited waivers of licensing requirements for NWSL coaches, revoking licenses for disciplined individuals, the NWSL adopting a USSF-approved investigation protocol, a requirement that NWSL owners, staff and players participate in investigative interviews and produce relevant documents and an NWSL mandate for annual training of players and coaches on policies involving verbal and emotional abuse, sexual misconduct, harassment and retaliation.She additionally said a coach should not serve as general manager and should not have sole authority over trades, housing and medical decisions, and that the USSF, NWSL and teams establish a player safety officer who will file quarterly reports.She said the USSF should consider whether to increase NWSL capital requirements and should institute an annual review of team culture and coaching practices and penalize leagues that do not meet standards. She said the USSF should require the NWSL to conduct and review annual player surveys that include questions about coaching conduct.\"The participant safety taskforce will convene leaders in soccer at all levels across the country to coordinate efforts to implement the Yates report's recommendations and to ensure increased clarity on conduct-related policies and procedures,\" Shim said.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne)Tennessee, Ohio State, Georgia, and Clemson were the top four teams in the first College Football Playoff rankings of the season released Tuesday night, four days before the Volunteers and Bulldogs square off on the field.Michigan was fifth, followed by Alabama and unbeaten TCU.Tennessee is No. 1 in the CFP rankings for the first time, starting ahead of a group of teams that have become regulars at the top of the selection committee's top 25. The Volunteers have already beaten the Crimson Tide and LSU, which was ranked 10th.Tennessee has been one of the season's biggest surprises, starting the season unranked in the AP poll and jumping out to an 8-0 start for the first time since the Vols won their last national title in 1998. \"We've tried to enjoy the journey,\" second-year Tennessee coach Josh Heupel told ESPN. \"Three years ago, it didn't look like this.\"Heupel took over after Jeremy Pruitt was fired following a 3-7 season.Only one team that has been No. 1 in the committee's initial rankings has not made the playoff, but only about half the teams in first top four managed to finish there.The committee began its weekly in-person meetings at hotel in Grapevine, Texas, on Monday and revealed the first of six weekly rankings.The final rankings that set the CFP field of four are set for Dec. 4. The 13-person panel is led by a first-time chairman Boo Corrigan, the athletic director of North Carolina State.Corrigan said there was some consideration for Ohio State and Georgia as No. 1, but Tennessee's victories against Alabama and at LSU won the day.The Buckeyes' explosive offense and overall dominance gave them a slight edge on Georgia.He said Michigan's weak nonconference schedule (Hawaii, Colorado State and Connecticut) and Clemson's 5-0 record against teams with winning records gave the Tigers the nod for the fourth spot.\"The wins at Wake (Forest), at Florida State, over N.C. State, over Syracuse, really did push (Clemson) over the top,\" Corrigan said. Oregon was eighth followed by Pac-12 rival Southern California at ninth.The highest ranked team from outside the Power Five conferences was Tulane at No. 19. The highest ranked champion from the Group of Five conferences earns a spot in New Year's Six bowl.The CFP semifinals are scheduled to be played at the Fiesta and Peach Bowls on Dec. 31, with the championship game set for Jan. 9 in Inglewood, California.Even before the rankings were unveiled Tuesday night, it was clear which teams still have a chance to play for a national championship.A glance at the conference standings reveals 14 contenders, all in the Power Five. Sorry, there will be no Cincinnati-style interloper from the Group of Five this season for the selection committee to consider.A conference-by-conference assessment of who is in the race and the paths to the CFP, with AP Top 25 rankings.Clemson (8-0, AP No. 5)The Tigers had their streak of six straight playoff appearances snapped last year, but are well positioned to get back, with no ranked opponents left before a likely ACC title game against North Carolina. No unbeaten Power Five champion has ever missed the playoff. A glance at the Big Ten and SEC suggests getting in as a one-loss conference champion could be dicey for the Tigers.No. 17 North Carolina (7-1, AP No. 17)Run the table, beating unbeaten Clemson in the ACC title game, gets the Tar Heels in the conversation, but they'll need some upsets in other leagues to clear the way.No. 7 TCU (8-0, AP No. 7)See above, re: unbeaten Power Five champions. The Horned Frogs flirt with disaster weekly and have some defensive issues. That's a profile the selection committee tends to look upon skeptically. They'll probably need to stay unbeaten to get in and it's going to be really tough for them to stay unbeaten with the way they have been playing.Ohio State (8-0, AP No. 2) and Michigan (8-0, AP No. 4)Both have been dominant. Neither has played a particularly strenuous schedule and that won't change much before they meet Thanksgiving weekend. Still, either is lock by winning out.Either would stay in the mix by being a 12-1 conference champion. And the loser of the rivalry game at 11-1 probably still holds out hope to get in.Illinois (7-1, AP No. 14)The Illini have a game against Michigan the week before the Wolverines play Ohio State. That means Illinois could finish 12-1 with either two victories against Michigan or one against Michigan and one against Ohio State.It's not likely to happen, but that would put the Illini in the playoff.Oregon (7-1, AP No. 8), USC (7-1, AP No. 9) and UCLA (7-1, No. 10)They all need to run the table to have a chance and even then that might not be enough. The Ducks will have to overcome a 49-3 loss to Georgia in their opener. The Trojans have a bad defense and won't get much of a bump by beating Notre Dame. UCLA played one of the weakest nonconference schedules in the country.What's the best option for the Pac-12? The guess here is a 12-1 USC with victories against UCLA and Oregon and one-point loss to a good Utah team.Georgia (8-0, AP No. 1) and Tennessee (8-0, AP No. 2)The loser of Saturday's showdown in Athens is not eliminated, especially if its the Volunteers, with a victory over Alabama already in hand.Alabama (6-1, AP No. 6) and Mississippi (8-1, AP No. 11)The Crimson Tide and Rebels can't afford another loss -- they play each other in two weeks -- but either would breeze into the CFP by winning out. The most SEC-centric scenario the rest of the country needs to root against is Alabama winning out, beating Georgia in the SEC championship game, and leaving the Tide and Bulldogs at 12-1 and Tennessee at 11-1 with a close loss to Georgia.LSU (6-2, AP No. 15)A two-loss team has never made the playoff, but the SEC champion has never missed the playoff. If the Tigers beat Alabama and avenge a loss to Tennessee on the way to a conference title they could break precedent.Follow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)DENVER (AP) -- A year ago, Mike Conley Jr. was on a team mentioned as a championship contender. This year, the Utah Jazz aren't in that conversation.That doesn't change Conley's approach.\"We're trying to win every day,\" Conley said.So far, the Jazz are winning more days than not. And two weeks into the NBA season, there are some surprises -- some good, some bad, with the Jazz finding themselves on the more fun side of that ledger.Conley and the Jazz are off to a 6-2 start after Monday's win over Memphis. Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs are 5-2, which matches the team's best start since they were 6-1 on the way to winning the NBA title in the 2013-14 season.If the Jazz and Spurs were tanking, they're definitely doing it wrong.Not even the lure of landing the winning lottery ticket that will provide 7-foot-3 French teen Victor Wembanyama -- who has skills often compared to Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Dirk Nowitzki -- is enough to get the Jazz and Spurs to try and not win. Quite the contrary. They're playing hard, playing the right way, playing defense and it's working.\"They're young enough they don't know any better,\" Popovich said of his squad. \"They just keep playing hard. ... They're pretty much obeying the basketball gods, doing all the simple things that help win games.\"They should be feeling pretty happy in a couple other cities, too. Cleveland was 5-1 entering Monday, as was Portland. On the flip side of the surprise coin -- Brooklyn was 2-5, the Los Angeles Lakers started 0-5 before getting their first win, and Miami is 2-5 entering a game Tuesday against Golden State. The reigning champs aren't exactly setting the world ablaze either, off to a 3-4 start.It's early. There's almost a whole season left to go. But San Antonio and Utah are surprising just about everybody so far -- well, everybody except themselves.\"We just do our job,\" Conley said. \"At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what people say.\"It wasn't uncommon to think the Jazz and Spurs might be among the teams that vie to be among the odds-on favorites for Wembanyama (the bottom three teams each have a 14 probability to land the No 1 pick). The Spurs are extremely young and feature a lineup consisting of hardly household names. The Jazz spent the summer trading away three of their biggest pieces in Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert and Bojan Bogdanovic. \"For some reason, the league goes, 'Oh, Utah is tanking because they got rid of Donovan and Rudy and Bogdanovic,'\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone recently said. \"Tell Mike Conley that. Tell Jordan Clarkson that. Tell Lauri Markkanen that. Those guys are NBA players and have played in a lot of big games. They're playing hard. They're getting out and running and they're defending.\"Credit should go to Utah coach Will Hardy, who was mentored by Popovich. Among the lessons Hardy picked up from Popovich -- his former boss in San Antonio, before Hardy spent last season as an assistant in Boston -- was the art of fostering relationships.\"He taps into that human element very, very well,\" said Hardy, who spent 11 seasons with Popovich and the Spurs, including five as an assistant coach. \"For all of his greatness from an X's-and-O's standpoint or an in-game coaching standpoint, it's all the stuff he does in-between games, on the human side, that for me separates him.\"Hardy's team has quickly picked up on the building cohesion part. An illustration: The Jazz all recently gathered in a room in New Orleans during a trip and \"just chilled, and had fun,\" explained Malik Beasley, who was acquired as part of the massive deal this offseason that sent Gobert to Minnesota. On plane rides, they've been known meet in a group to chat and break down game film.\"We have a great vibe,\" Beasley added. \"It's going to be fun to go to where we want to go to.\"Which, so far, is north in the standings, not south. \"We're tired of people being surprised,\" Beasley said. \"We're a good team, too.\"The Jazz remain a huge longshot to win the NBA title this season, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The same applies to Orlando, Oklahoma City, Indiana, Houston, Sacramento, Detroit and San Antonio. All of those clubs are the ones expected to be in the running for the No. 1 pick and the chance at Wembanyama. Not that the Spurs and Jazz have been paying any attention. Or caring what others believe. Popovich has a bunch of kids playing like seasoned vets.\"I don't think they even know what the capital of Texas is,\" Popovich cracked. \"But I don't care.\"Added Spurs guard/forward Keldon Johnson, who was part of the team that won Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021: \"We're playing great team basketball. We're making each other better. It's fun playing basketball that way.\"AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP freelance writer Mike Cranston contributed.AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

There was a smattering of boos at the ballpark when the washout was announced an hour before the scheduled first pitch on Halloween night.Game 4 will now be played Wednesday and Game 5 is set for the scheduled travel day on Thursday night -- Game 5 will compete with the NFL game that has, of all teams, the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles in Houston against the Texans.There will be a travel day on Friday if necessary. That had been the original date of Game 6.Game 6 has been rescheduled for Saturday and Game 7 would be Sunday.

Noah Syndergaard had been scheduled to start for Philadelphia before the rainout.PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NBA stripped the Philadelphia 76ers of second-round draft picks in 2023 and 2024 on Monday after an investigation into tampering during offseason free-agency moves.The league said the Sixers engaged in discussions involving free agents P.J. Tucker and Danuel House Jr. before the date when talks could begin. Teams were not allowed to have conversations with agents or players on free-agent contracts before 6 p.m. on June 30.Tucker signed a 30 million, three-year contract and House signed for 8.4 million over two years. The Sixers were able to sign Tucker to the full mid-level exception and House to the bi-annual exception because star guard James Harden declined his 47.4 million option and agreed to be paid about 14.5 million less this coming season to give the 76ers flexibility in signing players.If Harden had opted in before his June 30 deadline, Philadelphia would have had a much more difficult time finding the money to lure free agents.ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Ducks defenseman Jamie Drysdale has a torn labrum in his left shoulder, possibly sidelining him for the rest of the season.Drysdale injured the shoulder during the Ducks' loss at Vegas last Friday, and he will have surgery soon, the team announced Monday. He is expected to be out for four to six months.The 20-year-old Drysdale is a promising playmaker chosen sixth overall by Anaheim in the 2020 draft. He has no points with a minus-3 rating in eight games this season for the rebuilding Ducks, who snapped a seven-game skid Sunday night by beating Toronto.Drysdale recorded four goals and 28 assists as one of the NHL's youngest players last year. He made his league debut as an 18-year-old in March 2021, scoring eight points in 24 games to finish that season.CHICAGO (AP) -- Mana Shim, a former player for the National Women's Soccer League and the U.S. under-23 national team, will chair the U.S. Soccer Federation's taskforce to prevent the abuse and harassment of women that was found to be systemic in the sport.The USSF created a participant safety taskforce following a report issued Oct. 3 by former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates.Five of 10 coaches in the NWSL in 2021 were fired or stepped down amid allegations of misconduct, and NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird resigned.Shim, 31, was a midfielder for the Portland Thorns (2013-17) and Houston Dash (2018-19) and also played for Japan's Iga Kunoichi in 2015 and Sweden's Vaxjo in 2017.

(AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File)FILE - Saudi Aramco engineers walk in front of a gas turbine generator at Khurais oil field during a tour for journalists, 150 kilometers east-northeast of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on June 28, 2021. Oil giant Saudi Aramco on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022 reported a 42.4 billion profit in the third quarter of this year, buoyed by higher global energy prices. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Oil giant Saudi Aramco on Tuesday reported a 42.4 billion profit in the third quarter of this year, a 39 bump buoyed by the higher global energy prices that have filled the kingdom's coffers but helped fuel inflation worldwide.The oil firm's profits will help fund the kingdom's assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans for a futuristic city on the Red Sea coast, but also comes as the U.S. grows increasingly frustrated by higher prices at the pump chewing into American consumer's wallets. Those tensions yet again have chilled relations between Riyadh and Washington before the Nov. 8 midterm elections. In a note to investors, the predominantly state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. said its average barrel of crude sold for 101.70 in the third quarter -- up from 72.80 at the same point last year. It's Aramco's second-largest quarterly profit in its history, just before its second-quarter results this year saw a profit of 48.4 billion. It put its profits so far in 2022 at 130.3 billion, compared to 77.6 billion in 2021. It made 30.4 billion in the third quarter last year.\"While global crude oil prices during this period were affected by continued economic uncertainty, our long-term view is that oil demand will continue to grow for the rest of the decade given the world's need for more affordable and reliable energy,\" Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser said in a statement. Aramco will keep its dividend this quarter at 18.8 billion, the world's highest. Benchmark Brent crude traded just shy of 95 a barrel Tuesday. The sliver of Aramco that the kingdom has put on Riyadh's Tadawul stock market stood at 9.29 a share before trading Tuesday -- putting its valuation at just over 2 trillion. Only Apple's valuation, at 2.44 trillion, is higher.Saudi Arabia's vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world's cheapest places to produce crude. For every 10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional 40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance. That's crucial as Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, rely on oil revenues to fund the kingdom's government. The International Monetary Fund puts Saudi Arabia's breakeven price for crude at just under 80 a barrel. The prince also likely wants to use the high oil prices to help fund his planned 500 billion futuristic city called Neom on the Red Sea.OPEC and a loose confederation of other countries led by Russia agreed in early October to cut its production by 2 million barrels of oil a day, beginning in November.OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has insisted its decision came from concerns about the global economy. Analysts in the U.S. and Europe warn a recession looms in the West from inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes, as well as food and oil supplies being affected by Russia's war on Ukraine.In Washington, anger has grown with Saudi Arabia, particularly from President Joe Biden, who traveled to the kingdom in July and shared a fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed. That's even after he called the kingdom \"a pariah\" over Saudi security forces killing Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 -- a slaying American intelligence agencies believe came at the crown prince's orders.Biden recently warned the kingdom that \"there's going to be some consequences for what they've done\" as a gallon of regular gasoline costs on average 3.75. Gasoline prices often rank among the top concerns for American voters.Saudi Arabia lashed back, publicly claiming the Biden administration sought a one-month delay in the OPEC cuts that could have helped reduce the risk of a spike in gas prices ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. Biden on Monday separately accused oil companies of \"war profiteering\" as he raised the possibility of imposing a windfall tax on American energy companies if they don't boost domestic production.Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)TOKYO (AP) -- Asian shares were mostly higher Wednesday ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase to curb inflation. Oil prices rose more than 1 a barrel and U.S. futures were also higher. Stocks ended lower on Wall Street after an unexpectedly strong report on the job market raised concerns the Fed will keep the pressure on inflation with big rate increases. Chinese benchmarks extended gains after strong advances a day earlier driven by speculation the government might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6 to 15,554.91 while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5 to 2,983.76. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was up less than 0.1 at 27,685.42. Australia's SP/ASX 200 added 0.3 to 6,999.90. South Korea's Kospi was up less than 0.1 at 2,336.44, erasing gains that came earlier in the morning. South Korea's export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. But the Bank of Korea's minutes for a policy meeting last month showed a \"hawkish theme of bringing inflation under control against dovish surprise by two dissents,\" according to the Bank of America.\"Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after its stellar performance yesterday,\" said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore. The Fed is beginning a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that's expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that's triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point.The SP 500 fell 0.4 to 3,856.10 after having been up as much as 1 shortly after trading opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 to 32,653.20 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9, to 10,890.85. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3 to 1,851.39.Big technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Their big valuations give them more heft in pushing the broader market up or down. Also, rising interest rates tend to make the sector look less attractive because of those high valuations. Apple fell 1.8.Communication services stocks, retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending also helped drag down the overall SP 500, keeping gains in banks, energy firms and other sectors of the market in check.The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth. \"That really fuels the expectation that the Fed has to do more hiking,\" said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. \"The labor market is still too tight for the Fed.\"Long-term Treasury yields turned higher after the report in job openings came out and rose back near multiyear highs. Those high rates have helped push mortgage rates above 7 this year.The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.05 from 3.93 earlier in the morning. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to reflect market expectations of future moves by the Fed, rose to 4.54 from 4.40.\"The issue for investors is figuring out how long the hiking cycle will last,\" Draho said. \"(Fed Chair Jerome) Powell will want to leave all options on the table.\"Earnings remain a big focus for investors this week. Starbucks and Warner Bros. Discovery report earnings on Thursday and Cardinal Health does so on Friday.Outside of earnings, Abiomed surged 49.9 after health care giant Johnson  Johnson said it will pay 16.6 billion for the heart pump maker. Johnson  Johnson slipped 0.5.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 1.22 to 89.59 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 1.12 to 95.77 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 147.31 Japanese yen from 148.23 yen.

(AP Photo/ Tsafrir Abayov, File)JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's election on Tuesday, the country's fifth since 2019, largely pits familiar faces against one another in a tight race. Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now the opposition leader, is hoping to return to power and replace his main rival, interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The election is once again seen as a referendum on Netanyahu's fitness to rule while he faces corruption charges. One new player has burst onto the scene. Far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir has been surging in opinion polls and could be key to lifting Netanyahu to victory. Here's a look at the main players: After more than a year in the opposition, Israel's longest-serving prime minister seeks a return to power while on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. His Likud party is projected to remain the largest in the 120-seat Knesset, and he aims for a majority through support of ultra-Orthodox and ultra-nationalist allies. Netanyahu's campaign has focused on attacking the perceived shortcomings of the government that ousted him last year, and decrying its inclusion of an Arab party. Election polls project that his Likud party and its presumed allies are hovering close to the 61-seat parliamentary majority required to form a governing coalition.Israel's caretaker prime minister took office in June after the ruling coalition he cobbled together disintegrated. He has campaigned on his government's accomplishments in its limited time in office, including the recent maritime border deal with Lebanon.Polls predict that Lapid's Yesh Atid party will be the second-largest party, after Likud. It remains unclear whether he will once again be able to unite disparate parties and form a coalition instead of Netanyahu. The co-leader of the Religious Zionism party has a long history of anti-Arab rhetoric -- including convictions for incitement and supporting a terrorist group. As a lawyer, he spent much of his career defending Jewish extremists in court.His party is ardently pro-settlement in the occupied West Bank, takes an even harsher line toward Palestinians living there and has cast doubt on the loyalty of Israel's own Palestinian minority. Many of its leaders are openly homophobic.Ben-Gvir, heir to the outlawed racist Kach party, has pledged support for Netanyahu -- and has hone so far as to promise to annul the former prime minister's trial and to be put in charge of the country's police force. Religious Zionism is projected to balloon to the third-largest party in parliament, more than doubling in size since the last election and giving it a powerful voice in any Netanyahu government. In part it is buoyed by support from young ultra-Orthodox voters.Israel's defense minister joined forces with other former Netanyahu allies -- including Justice Minister Gideon Saar -- after the break-up of the last government. He has campaigned on the issues of national security and preventing Netanyahu from returning to power. A campaign video released Sunday said: \"We must stop the shame. We must stop the threat,\" referring to the possibility of Ben-Gvir becoming a Cabinet minister. Gantz's Machane Mamlachti is projected to win around 10 seats in parliament, which would likely make it the fourth largest. Gantz appears to have the most crossover appeal of any of the members of the anti-Netanyahu bloc. He could become a key player in post-election coalition negotiations.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Days after more than 150 perished in South Korea's deadliest crowd surge, a quiet but wrenching reminder of the disaster remained. (Nov 1)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Days after more than 150 Halloween revelers died in South Korea's deadliest crowd surge, a quiet but wrenching reminder of the disaster remained Tuesday: Hundreds of abandoned shoes have been laid out in neat rows in a badminton court in the capital, Seoul.Police have assembled the crumpled tennis shoes, loafers and Chuck Taylors -- part of 1.5 tons of personal objects left by victims and survivors of the tragedy -- in hopes that the owners, or their friends and family, will retrieve them. The deadly crush in the nearby nightlife district Itaewon happened after tens of thousands gathered for Halloween celebrations Saturday evening. Part of the crowd got jammed in a narrow, downhill alley between a dense row of storefronts and the district's landmark Hamilton Hotel. Partygoers were seen carrying out the wounded and dead, while dozens of lifeless bodies covered in blankets were laid out in rows on the nearby pavement. Most of the victims were women and many of them were missing shoes, which experts say reflects the force of a crowd surge that stripped footwear from their feet in the crush. Some 250 pairs of shoes at the gym are part of a huge collection of abandoned items found in Itaewon following the tragedy. There are also hundreds of pieces of clothing, including coats and movie character costumes, as well as handbags, smartphones, Bluetooth earpieces and a few passports, including at least one belonging to a U.S. citizen.Yongsan police officials, who will keep the gym open for 24 hours until Sunday, didn't immediately confirm how many of the items have been returned to their owners. As of Tuesday afternoon, 156 people were confirmed dead and 151 were being treated for injuries, with 29 of them in critical condition. Officials say 26 of the dead were foreign nationals, including five Iranians, four Chinese, four Russians, two Americans and two Japanese citizens.

(Bo Amstrup/Ritzau Scanpix via AP)COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was in a strong position to remain in power after her Social Democrats won the most votes Tuesday in Denmark's election and a center-left bloc in Parliament that backs her appeared set to retain a majority by just one seat.The result was preliminary and based on the assumption that a vote count in Greenland expected early Wednesday would give the autonomous Danish territory's two seats to the center-left bloc.\"I am so thrilled and proud. We have gotten the best election result in 20 years,\" Frederiksen told supporters early Wednesday in Copenhagen.Despite the success, Frederiksen, who heads a Social Democratic minority government, said she would resign as prime minister and try to form a new government with broader support across the political divide, something she had said suggested before the election.\"It is also clear there is no longer a majority behind the government in its current form. Therefore, tomorrow I will submit the government's resignation to the queen,\" said Frederiksen, adding that she would meet with other parties about forming a new government. Frederiksen was forced to call the vote earlier this month amid the fallout from her government's contentious decision to cull millions of minks as a pandemic response measure. The cull and chilling images of mass graves of minks have haunted Frederiksen since 2020 and eventually led to cracks in the center-left bloc.The Social Democrats remained Denmark's top party with 28 of the vote, but it remained unclear long into the night whether the center-left parties together would reach the 90 seats needed for a majority in the 179-seat Parliament. Exit polls suggested they would fall short, but the decisive seat flipped at the very end of the vote count. Before that former Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen appeared set to become kingmaker. His newly formed centrist party won 9 of the vote for 16 seats, according to the preliminary results.Lokke Rasmussen said he too wanted to Mette Frederiksen to try to form a government but he would not point at her \"as prime minister.\"A two-time government leader who lost the 2019 election to Frederiksen and abandoned the center-right Liberal party following an internal power struggle, Lokke Rasmussen, wouldn't say whom he would back as the next prime minister or whether he saw that role for himself.\"I know for sure that Denmark needs a new government, \" he told jubilant supporters in Copenhagen. \"Who is going to sit at the end of the table we do not know.\"Denmark may be a small, tranquil country known for having some of the happiest people on Earth, but its politics is filled with intrigue that will be familiar to fans of the fictional Danish TV drama series \"Borgen.\"Before the election, Frederiksen, 44, floated the idea of a broader alliance that would also include opposition parties, but was rebuffed by opposition leaders Jakob Ellemann-Jensen of the Liberals and Soren Pape Poulsen of the Conservatives, who both ran as candidates for prime minister in a center-right government.Even though the election result suggested she could ostensibly carry on as prime minster with only center-left support, Frederiksen said she would keep her ambition to also reach out to opposition parties.\"The Social Democrats went to the election to form a broad government,\" she said. \"I will investigate whether it can be done.\"Denmark's more than 4 million voters could choose among over 1,000 candidates -- the most ever -- from 14 parties. Four of the 179 seats in the Danish legislature, Folketinget, are reserved for the Faeroe Islands and Greenland, which are autonomous Danish territories.Concerns about rising inflation and energy prices linked to Russia's war in Ukraine and a shortage of nurses in the public health care system were key themes in election campaigns.\"What I feel is important and is a worry to many are the soaring prices, whether it be electricity, bread or gasoline,\" said Inge Bjerre Hansen, 82, after casting her vote in Copenhagen. \"My son is reducing the number of his visits because it has become expensive to fill the tank (of his car).\"Unlike in previous elections, immigration received little attention. Denmark has some of Europe's strictest immigration laws and there is broad agreement among the major parties to keep it that way.That and internal squabbles help explain the collapse of the populist Danish People's Party, which spearheaded Denmark's crackdown on immigration two decades ago. Once polling over 20, the party recorded its worst parliamentary election result since its creation in 1995, with around 3 of the vote, the results showed.The Danish People's Party faced competition for nationalist voters from new right-wing parties. Among them are the Denmark Democrats, created in June by former hardline immigration minister Inger Stojberg. In 2021, Stojberg was convicted by the rarely used Impeachment Court for a 2016 order to separate asylum-seeking couples if one of the partners was a minor.She was eligible to run for office again after serving her 60-day sentence. The official results showed her party getting 8.Frederiksen, who became Denmark's youngest prime minister when she took office at 41 more than three years ago, teamed up with the opposition to hike NATO-member Denmark's defense spending in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Her steadfast leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was partly overshadowed by the mink-culling episode.The decision to slaughter up to 17 million minks to protect humans from a mutation of the coronavirus was taken in haste and without the required legislation in place. It dealt a devastating blow to Danish mink farmers, even though there was no evidence the mutated virus found among some minks was more dangerous than other strains.Ritter reported from Stockholm.

A major search and rescue operation was underway Tuesday for dozens of people missing after the boat they were on capsized and sank in stormy weather overnight off the coast of an island near the Greek capital. The coast guard said nine survivors, all men, had been found on an uninhabited islet south of the island of Evia and had been picked up by a coast guard vessel. (Greek Coast Guard via AP)ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's coast guard searched Tuesday for dozens of migrants reported missing after the overloaded sailboat they were on capsized and sank in rough seas off an island near Athens, authorities said.The incident overnight was the latest in a series of recent shipwrecks involving migrant boats that have left dozens of people dead or missing in Greek waters.Ten survivors, all men, were rescued and transported to the island of Evia, off the eastern coast of the Greek capital. The first nine were discovered overnight on an uninhabited islet south of Evia, and told authorities there had been around 68 people on the sailboat when it sank.The tenth survivor was plucked from the water hours later, on Tuesday afternoon, by a cargo ship participating in the search and rescue operation, the coast guard said.The initial survivors told Greek authorities the boat had set sail from Izmir on the Turkish coast. There was no information on their nationalities. The rescue operation took place in particularly rough weather, with gale force winds on Tuesday morning. The Kafireas Strait where the boat sank, between the islands of Evia and Andros, is notoriously treacherous, with rough seas common even in lighter winds. Images of the operation released by the coast guard showed a small group of people standing on rocks beneath a cliff waving for help, and waves crashing over the coast guard patrol boat during the nighttime search and rescue. A coast guard photo showed the survivors wrapped in emergency foil blankets sitting on the deck of the patrol boat. The coast guard said authorities were initially alerted in a distress call early Tuesday about a boat in trouble, but the callers did not provide a location. An aircraft, a coast guard patrol boat and two nearby ships were involved in the search and rescue. A separate maritime rescue operation continued Tuesday afternoon for seven people missing from an inflatable dinghy that capsized Monday with 12 people reportedly on board. Four survivors were rescued Monday from that incident off the coast of the eastern Aegean island of Samos, which lies near the Turkish coast.The coast guard said a cargo ship participating in the operation located a body within Greek territorial waters Tuesday. A Turkish coast guard vessel which had not been part of the rescue picked up the body, the coast guard said. During the recovery, the Turkish vessel allegedly harassed a Greek coast guard vessel and tried to damage it, while also \"displaying weaponry,\" Greece's coast guard said. Tension has been high between neighbors and NATO allies Greece and Turkey, which are at odds over a series of issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea.Greek Shipping Minister Giannis Plakiotakis slammed Turkey for \"allow(ing) ruthless smuggling rings to send people to their deaths, with Greece saving as many as it can.\" He alleged the Turkish coast guard vessel had acted provocatively by entering Greek territorial waters, \"perhaps wishing to cause an incident.\"Greece, Plakiotakis said in a statement, \"will continue to save lives, without being dragged into the games Turkey seeks in the Aegean.\"Turkey strongly rejected the accusations, insisting that the body was recovered in international waters, and that it was a Greek boat that approached the Turkish vessel dangerously close. A statement from the Turkish Coast Guard said it was personnel on board the Greek vessel that pointed a weapon at the Turks, prompting a strong response from the Turkish vessel. \"The attitude adopted by the Greek Coast Guard personnel during the search and rescue operation whose sole purpose is to save human life, carried out in international waters in the Turkish Search and Rescue Region, is against international law as well as against human rights,\" the statement read.Thousands of people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, Asia and the Middle East attempt to enter the European Union through Greece each year.Most make the short but often perilous crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands in inflatable dinghies. Others opt to attempt to circumvent Greece in overcrowded sailboats and yachts heading straight to Italy.At least 27 people drowned in two separate incidents last month. In one, 18 people died when a boat that had set sail from Turkey sank off the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos. In the other, a yacht carrying about 100 people sank in a gale, killing at least nine and leaving six missing. Off the coast of Italy, more than 900 migrants rescued by charity boats in the last few days waited Tuesday for Italian authorities to assign ports where the crowded vessels could disembark passengers. So far, Italy's new far-right-led government is keeping to the policies of earlier governments of not immediately granting authorization for the migrants to come ashore.The new interior minister has said he plans to crack down on boats suspected of aiding illegal immigration.Separately, some 280 migrants stepped ashore Tuesday on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa. Hundreds of others were transferred from the island's chronically overcrowded housing for asylum-seekers to larger facilities in Sicily or the Italian mainland.Frances D'Emilio in Rome and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed to this report.

(Nov. 1)CHICAGO (AP) -- As many as 15 people, including three children, were injured in a drive-by shooting on Halloween night that sent shots flying into a crowd along a Chicago street corner, police said.Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the three juvenile victims are a 3-year-old, an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old. The others wounded by gunfire Monday night are adults ranging in age from their 30s to their 50s.In addition, police said a woman fleeing from the shooting scene was struck by a vehicle as she crossed traffic. She was hospitalized in fair condition.The Chicago Fire Department said it sent at least 10 ambulances to the scene in Chicago's Garfield Park neighborhood. Brown said the victims' conditions range from non-life threatening injuries to critical condition. No fatalities were immediately reported and police were waiting to interview the shooting victims after they received medical treatment.Brown said the drive-by shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. and was over in a matter of seconds. It was captured on police surveillance video, which investigators are reviewing. Preliminary information indicates there were at least two shooters seen on the video, firing indiscriminately into the crowd.Community activist Andrew Holmes said the children shot during the incident are \"just young.\" \"They're putting on an outfit just to enjoy the evening and then you got a clown that goes and discharges that weapon, bringing great bodily harm to these families,\" he told WGN-TV.Investigators are trying to determine a motive and get a description of the car and those responsible, Brown said. No one was in custody.Brown said there were no known conflicts at the street corner Monday night. Brown said there were several large groups at the corner, which is a popular gathering spot in the neighborhood. Some were reportedly attending a vigil.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The city health bureau said guests all tested negative and were allowed to leave by 8:30 p.m.No details of a possible outbreak were released, but 1.3 million residents of the downtown Yangpu district were ordered Friday to stay at home for virus testing.President Xi Jinping's government is sticking to a severe \"Zero COVID\" strategy that has shut down Shanghai and other cities this year to isolate every case while other countries are easing anti-virus controls.Also Tuesday, authorities in the southern territory of Macao were carrying out virus tests on all of its 700,000 residents after one case was found last week.\"Zero COVID\" has kept infection rates relatively low but at a high cost as businesses struggle with repeated shutdowns.Hong Kong's main stock market index surged 5.2 on Tuesday after a comment circulated on Chinese social media that said the ruling Communist Party might set up a \"reopening committee\" to look at ways to wind down anti-virus controls.A foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was \"not aware of what you just mentioned\" when asked about the rumor.Outbreaks in Shanghai in March led to a shutdown that confined most of its 25 million people to their homes for two months.The city government appealed to anyone who had visited the Shanghai Disney Resort since Thursday to undergo three days of nucleic acid testing and avoid gathering in groups.Disney said Monday parts of the resort closed due to anti-virus regulations but gave no indication visitors were kept inside. It said Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown and Wishing Star Park were closed while two hotels were operating normally.Some rides and other amusements kept operating Monday while visitors were tested, according to social media posts.\"Please return and take a tour in the park,\" a video on the popular Sina Weibo platform showed an employee in a mask saying to guests. \"The park's gates are all closed temporarily, and you cannot leave now.\"Another video on Sina Weibo showed technicians in white protective suits who appeared to be taking throat swabs from guests after dark while police watched and a fireworks display lit up the sky behind them.\"The most beautiful nucleic acid detection point,\" the account user wrote.In the central city of Zhengzhou, thousands of employees who assemble Apple Inc.'s new iPhone 14 walked away from a factory operated by Taiwan's Foxconn following outbreaks and complaints about unsafe working conditions. Foxconn said it has implemented \"closed loop management,\" the official term for employees living at their workplace and having no outside contact.AP video producer Liu Zheng contributed.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Residents in Kyiv queued for water after Russian strikes knocked out water and power supplies. (Nov. 1) (AP Video/Adam Pemble)KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- The decorative candles Yaroslav Vedmid bought more than a year ago were never meant to be lit, but the dried wax that now clings to them attests to how they've been used almost nightly -- a consequence of power cuts across Ukraine.Seated at the dinner table with his wife in a village on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, the two can't count the number of times they've eaten in the dark since Russian attacks triggered the blackouts beginning in early October. Moscow has openly declared its intention to target the country's energy infrastructure and drive the nation into the cold.\"When you're relying on electricity, the worst thing is that you can't plan ... Psychologically it's very uncomfortable,\" said Vedmid, a 44-year-old business owner in Bilohorodka. The cuts are getting longer -- nearly 12 hours of outages a day, he said.So far, Russia has destroyed about 40 of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, affecting 16 regions, according to the Ukrainian government.The latest assault came Monday, when a massive barrage of Russian cruise missile and drone strikes hit Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities, knocking out water and power supplies in apparent retaliation for what Moscow alleged was a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea fleet. In Kyiv, some 80 of consumers in the city of 3 million were left without water because of damage to a power facility Monday. By Tuesday, water was fully restored as well as some power. Kyiv region governor, Oleksiy Kuleba said that 20,000 apartments in the region remained without power.The unpredictable rolling blackouts are increasing as the government scrambles to stabilize the energy grid and repair the system ahead of winter. The cuts add another layer of angst and uncertainty to a population already struggling with the stress of nearly nine months of war.To try to ease people's burdens, energy companies are publishing daily schedules of when neighborhoods won't have power. But it's not consistent, especially as strikes intensify. Last week a power station in the central region was damaged, causing an emergency shutdown and prompting the government to warn citizens of tougher and longer outages.\"Unfortunately, the destruction and damage are serious,\" Kyiv region Gov. Oleksiy Kuleba said in a Telegram post. \"It is necessary to prepare for emergency power outages for an indefinite period,\" he said.Across the capital, residents are stocking up on heaters, blankets, warm clothing and power banks to charge electronics. While most say they're willing to bear the brunt of the blackouts for the sake of the war, the frequency and fluidity of the outages are taxing.Starting Tuesday, the government plans to change the schedule of the Kyiv subway to include longer wait times to save energy.On the day that The Associated Press visited Vedmid's house in October, there was an unscheduled five-hour power outage and then a scheduled one during dinner.Every time the power shuts off, the family loses internet service. Because the village also has a weak phone network, the household is often unable to communicate with others.Staring at his mobile phone, Vedmid shrugs. Google Maps isn't working, and he doesn't know how long it will take to reach the train station for a planned trip with his wife to the country.But what concerns him most are the months ahead when temperatures could drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit). \"My major fears are for (the) cold part of season, for winter, because right now it influences our comfort but doesn't threaten our lives,\" he said.The family has ordered a generator, which should be installed by December, but demand has spiked and not everyone can afford to buy one or the fuel to run it. Diesel has doubled in price since the start of the war, local residents said.Still, some have found a silver lining to the shutdowns. Vedmid's wife, Olena, said she reads more books rather than constantly refreshing the internet to see the latest war developments. It helps her feel less anxious.If not for Russia's incessant shelling and the lack of repair equipment, much of which must be imported, the damage could be restored within weeks, energy experts said.\"The main danger is repeated missile attacks,\" said professor Gennadii Riabtsev, chief researcher on energy security at the National Institute for Strategic Studies. Residents of cities near the front lines, such as Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, will suffer the most from the outages, he said.DTEK, Ukraine's main energy company, said it has run out of equipment for repairs. The cost of the equipment runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Russia is likely to continue the war into the winter, hoping to weaken Western support for Ukraine and \"freeze Europe into surrender,\" according to a report issued this week by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.Residents near the front lines say they are bracing for conditions to get worse.Mariia Chupinina was dealing with blackouts in Kharkiv even before the rolling outages began in the region this week. The woman who fosters orphaned children lives on the fifth floor of an apartment building and takes care of four babies who are less than 12 months old. When there's no electricity, it's impossible to heat the apartment, and every time they leave, they have to walk down five flights of stairs in the dark, she told the AP by phone.If Chupinina forgets to plan ahead, the babies won't have anything to eat. \"If you have not prepared, you don't have time to fill the Thermos, and there's no warm water or formula,\" she said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

In 2018 it lost 3-2 in stoppage time to Belgium after leading 2-0.

Several people have died in one of the most destructive storms to lash the Philippines this year with dozens more feared missing after villagers were buried in a boulder-laden mudslide. (Philippine Coast Guard via AP)MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday blamed years of deforestation for a deadly mudslide that buried a mountainside community amid last week's torrential rains set off by a storm that has left more than 130 people dead across the country.During an aerial inspection of the widespread damage wrought by Tropical Storm Nalgae in southern Maguindanao province, the president said he pointed out to the provincial governor how the mudslides cascaded on denuded slopes of Mount Minandar.\"I noticed that in all places where the landslides came down, the mountains were bald. That's the problem,\" Marcos Jr. told provincial governors in a televised meeting with key Cabinet members in Maguindanao to discuss the worst natural disaster he faced since taking office in June.\"We have to include tree-planting in our flood control,\" he said. \"We have been hearing about this over and over again, but we still cut the trees, so that's what happens, these landslides.\"The storm's vast rain clouds swamped a wide swath of the Philippine archipelago, leaving at least 132 people dead and lashing another 2.4 million people, including some who had to be rescued from the roofs of flooded houses. More than 6,500 houses were either damaged, torn down or swept away by flash floods, according to disaster-response officials.The storm made landfall Saturday in the eastern Philippines and blew out into the South China Sea on Sunday.The worst-hit area was Maguindanao's Kusiong village, which lies between the foothills of Mount Minandar and the Moro Gulf.A night of heavy downpour Thursday loosened the upper reaches of the mountainside which crashed down in a boulder- and tree-laden deluge and buried about 5 hectares (12 acres) of the community, populated largely by the Teduray ethnic group, officials said.Twenty-one bodies, including those of children, have been pulled out by more than 260 army, police, firefighters, coast guard and civilian rescuers backed by a backhoe, two payloaders and sniffer dogs, said army Maj. Gen. Roy Galido. Only four remain missing, Galido said, citing Kusiong village leaders. But other local officials fear entire families may be buried, leaving no one to report them as missing.Naguib Sinarimbo, the interior minister for a Muslim autonomous region run by former separatist guerrillas that includes Maguindanao, told Marcos Jr. that a \"major number of deaths\" had occurred in Kusiong either due to the mudslide or flash floods that swept away houses and people. He did not elaborate but told The Associated Press earlier that between 80 to 100 people may have either been swept away by flash floods or hit by the mudslide.A video provided by the coast guard to media on Monday showed some of its men helping search for buried bodies in Kusiong by poking long wooden sticks into the muddy, light-brownish sludge.Officials told the president that disaster-preparedness has been complicated by the more unpredictable weather, including in Maguindanao, a mountainous region with marshy plains, which in the past was rarely hit by storms. Marcos Jr., a former provincial governor, agreed, saying it's been difficult to decide where to deploy rescue boats and other earth-moving equipment as typhoons approached.\"That's the problem today, there's really climate change now. It's undeniable,\" he said.About 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippine archipelago each year.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)People pay tribute to victims of a deadly accident following Saturday night's Halloween festivities on the street near the scene in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The narrow street in Seoul's popular Itaewon neighborhood was already packed with people celebrating Halloween as high school student Eunseo Kim and her friend pushed themselves into the crowd. Lines of people waiting for their faces to be painted or to get into restaurants slowed the flow of revelers walking through the party zone in South Korea's capital. As the 17-year-old slowly worked her way up the narrow alley on a hill, the crowd became increasingly compressed. \"Women were repeatedly saying 'please don't push,' as men were saying 'push, push,'\" she recalled. She began struggling to breathe as her chest was crushed. Then she lost her balance and fell.On the ground, Kim felt like she had become invisible to the crowd. People stepped on her ankle, wrist and calf, and she remembers thinking she was going to die. Incredibly, she survived, but at least 156 others were killed in the crush Saturday night, 101 of them women, primarily in their teens or 20s, according to figures released Tuesday by the Interior and Safety Ministry.Because they are often shorter and less physically strong than men, experts say women are particularly vulnerable during \"crowd turbulence\" situations similar to what unfolded in the Itaewon alleys on Saturday, when the density of a crowd hits a tipping point and leads to a deadly crush. \"Five to 10 centimeters in height makes a big difference when it comes to chest pressure,\" said Choi Sukjae, an emergency medicine specialist and public relations director of the Korean Emergency Medical Association. At about 172 centimeters (5' 8\"), Kim is taller than many other women in South Korea but still vividly recalls having the breath crushed out of her as people stuck their elbows out protectively and pushed into her chest.\"People were pressing me from both ways; my chest was compressed,\" she said.A dramatic video shot in an alley around the corner from where Kim was shows a handful of men managing to wind away from the suffocating crush. One man pulled himself up and out of the crowd by scaling the face of a building, then climbed across its illuminated sign and dropped back to a less packed part of the street, out of danger's way. More than 100,000 people are thought to have been in the Itaewon streets on Saturday. Hwang Minku, a video forensic expert, said it is difficult to discern the makeup of the crowd from the aerial images of the scene. Complicating the situation further, many wore costumes that made it hard or impossible to determine their sex or approximate age, though Halloween celebrations in South Korea tend to draw younger crowds. What is known is that of the 156 people killed, 12 were teenagers and 104 were in their 20s, according to the Interior and Safety Ministry. Thirty-one others were in their 30s, eight in their 40s, and one was in their 50s. Fifty-five were male and 101 female. Of 151 additional people who were injured, 29 remain in critical condition. Dirk Helbing, a professor of computational social science at ETH Zurich university who studies crowd dynamics, said the numbers of women and young people killed were \"shocking\" and needed to be further investigated before drawing final conclusions.\"I do not recall having seen any numbers in the past that (broke down) victims by gender or age,\" he said. \"The disaster shows that we are all vulnerable, perhaps to different degrees.\"Helbing has extensively studied Germany's 2010 Love Parade disaster, in which 21 people died as they tried to exit through a bottleneck in a \"crowd turbulence\" situation he said had \"striking similarities\" to the tragedy in Seoul. Crowd turbulence occurs when the group's density is so high that movement becomes fluid, with people pushing into one another involuntarily and transferring force between their bodies.\"These erratic forces cause a turbulent pattern of motion of the crowd ... (and) someone might stumble, thereby creating a hole in the crowd,\" Helbing said in an email. When that happens, people nearby no longer have the counterforce of the person in front of them and fall themselves, creating a domino effect as more and more people fall on top of each other, he said.\"It does not require any relentless behavior of other people or a readiness to hurt people,\" he said. 'In fact, in many cases of critical crowd conditions, many people are trying to help each other, but the situation may be desperate, and not even police or first aid units may be able to prevent the disaster from happening once crowd turbulence occurs.\" Ken Fallas, a Costa Rican architect who has worked in Seoul for the past eight years, was about 30 meters (yards) from the alley that was the center of the crush at its peak. He remembers a feeling of helplessness as it unfolded.\"It is not something that you can control,\" Fallas said. \"Most people will think, like, no, if I will be in that situation I will just push back -- there's no way to push back -- we're talking about probably 300 people behind you and the pressure of 300 people ... to push back is impossible.\"Deeper into the alley where Fallas was trapped, Kim said that after she fell, her friend desperately tried to grab her but then disappeared into the crowd. \"I kept hearing people saying 'push, push' from the back, and people fell,\" she said. \"My friend tried to grab me and got swept away. It was as if a tsunami had swept them away.\"But she was one of the lucky ones, managing to get back to her feet with the help of a man in a police costume, and found her friend by a roadside club's stairway. A club employee pulled her and others inside and helped them escape through the back door to safety. Even having been that close to where most people were killed, Kim didn't realize anyone had been seriously injured until she saw a row of ambulances as she exited the club.\"I saw people on stretchers getting carried out and heard screaming,\" she said. \"But some people still thought the ambulances were part of the Halloween setup.\"Days later, she said her heart still races when she hears ambulance sirens, and she feels claustrophobic even in a group of people in her school cafeteria. \"Friends at school talk about the Itaewon tragedy, and it's very difficult for me to listen,\" she said.Tong-hyung Kim in Seoul and Kiko Rosario in Bangkok contributed to this story.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Toyota said Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, that its profit fell 31 in the last quarter as a shortage of computer chips offset foreign exchange gains from a weaker yen. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara, File)TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota said Tuesday that its profit fell 31 in the last quarter as a shortage of computer chips offset foreign exchange gains from a weaker yen. Toyota Motor Corp.'s quarterly profit through September totaled 434 billion yen, or 2.9 billion, down from nearly 627 billion yen a year earlier. The maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models said it faces many challenges, including rising interest rates, soaring materials costs and fluctuating exchange rates. A shortage in semiconductors, coronavirus lockdowns in Shanghai and flooding in South Africa also bit into earnings. The global auto industry has been slammed for some time by supply chain crunches because of COVID-19 lockdowns. \"We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers who are waiting for their vehicles. We are working to deliver them as soon as possible,\" Chief Officer Masahiro Yamamoto told reporters. Quarterly sales grew 22 to 9.2 trillion yen (63 billion), from 7.5 trillion yen a year earlier.During the first half of the April-March fiscal year, the favorable effects of a depreciating yen added 565 billion yen (3.8 billion) to Toyota's bottom line, the company said. A weak yen lifts the earnings of Japanese exporters like Toyota by boosting the value of its overseas earnings when they are converted into yen. The U.S. dollar was trading at about 110 yen a year ago but is now at nearly 150 yen. Toyota lowered its vehicle production forecast for the full fiscal year, from an earlier estimate of 9.7 million vehicles to 9.2 million vehicles. Toyota sold 2.6 million vehicles around the world in July-September, up from 2.5 million vehicles in the same period last year. It now expects to sell 10.4 million vehicles in this fiscal year, down from an earlier 10.7 million vehicles it had expected to sell globally. The latest target is still better than the 10.38 million vehicles Toyota sold in the previous fiscal year. Consolidated sales include Daihatsu, Hino and Lexus vehicles, as well as Toyota models. Toyota's chief communication officer, Jun Nagata, said inflationary pressures have Toyota reviewing its model prices, region by region. But for long-selling models, especially in Japan and the U.S., customers have \"strong attachments\" to certain models, and that means they have an impression about appropriate pricing, too. And so higher costs can't just be passed on to buyers, he said. Toyota stuck to its profit forecast for the full fiscal year at 2.3 trillion yen (15.6 billion), unchanged from its earlier projection. Toyota earned more than 2.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyamaCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Residents in Kyiv queued for water after Russian strikes knocked out water and power supplies. (Nov. 1) (AP Video/Adam Pemble)KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia reinforced its fighting force Tuesday with an annual fall draft of 120,000 men, and doubled the number of civilians it's trying to evacuate in anticipation of a major Ukrainian push to recapture the strategically vital southern port city of Kherson.Russian military officials have assured that conscripts to be called up over the next two months will not be sent to fight in Ukraine, including to the Kherson region, three other Ukrainian areas that Russia recently illegally annexed or to Crimea, which the Kremlin made part of Russia in 2014.However, the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said the Russian Defense Ministry \"is attempting to deceive the Russian population into believing that autumn conscripts will not be sent to fight in Ukraine, likely to prevent draft dodging.\"This year's fall draft was delayed because of an extraordinary partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists that President Vladimir Putin ordered Sept. 21 specifically to bolster his Ukraine invasion force. While Russian officials have declared the partial mobilization complete, critics have warned it could resume after military enlistment offices are freed up from processing fall conscripts.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that 87,000 of 300,000 reservists have been deployed for combat in Ukraine and that 3,000 military instructors with fighting experience in the country are training them.Reports suggest that many of the mobilized reservists are inexperienced, were told to procure basic items such as medical kits and flak jackets themselves, and did not receive proper training before deployment. Some were killed within days. After Putin's order, tens of thousands of men fled Russia to avoid serving in the military.Some of the fresh troops have reportedly been sent to Kherson, on the 1,100-kilometer (684-mile) front line. Russian-installed authorities in Kherson, fearing a major Ukrainian counterattack, on Tuesday reported relocating 70,000 residents, and they expanded an evacuation area to people living within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of the Dnieper River. The region's Kremlin-appointed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said the relocation of an additional 70,000 residents from the expanded evacuation zone would be completed this week and claimed it was ordered because Kyiv \"is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station\" to flood Kherson.Ukraine's military on Tuesday described the new evacuations as \"forced displacement,\" and the Russian-installed government of the Kherson regional district where the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and associated dam and reservoir are located announced it would undertake a \"forced evacuation\" on Sunday. The Ukrainian military said the Kherson regional administration had been relocated to Skadovsk, 100 kms (62 miles) south of the city of Kherson. In addition to the Kremlin's military draft, it moved on another front to bolster its forces. Authorities in Belarus on Tuesday approved the creation of two joint troop training centers with Moscow on the territory of the east European country, which borders Ukraine. Russia has previously used Belarus, its long-standing and economically dependent ally, as a springboard to send troops and missiles into Ukraine. Kyiv fears the Belarusian army could be drawn directly into the war.Elsewhere, concerns about radiation figured in two developments. Experts from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency inspected two Ukrainian sites that Russia identified as involved in its unfounded claims that Ukrainian authorities planned to set off radioactive \"dirty bombs\" in their own invaded country. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said the inspections for evidence of \"dirty bombs\" would be completed soon. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, claimed in a letter to the U.N. Security Council members last week that Ukraine's nuclear research facility and mining company \"received direct orders from (President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's regime to develop such a dirty bomb.\"Western nations have called Moscow's repeated claim \"transparently false.\" Ukrainian authorities dismissed it as an attempt to distract attention from alleged Russian plans to detonate a dirty bomb as a way to justify an escalation of hostilities.A second radiation concern involves fighting near Europe's largest nuclear power plant. The IAEA has stationed monitors at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, where a radiation leak could have catastrophic consequences. The Ukrainian president's office said Tuesday that cities and towns around the plant experienced more heavy shelling. In Nikopol, a city which faces the plant from across the wide Dnieper River, more than a dozen apartment buildings, a kindergarten, and businesses were damaged, the office said.Elsewhere on the battlefront, Russian strikes targeting eight regions of southeastern Ukraine killed at least four civilians and wounded four in 24 hours, Zelenskyy's office said. Russian shelling hit 14 towns and villages in the eastern Donetsk region Monday and Tuesday, destroying sections of railway track, damaging a power line and taking down mobile communications in some areas.The shelling killed three civilians, the region's governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said. Donetsk is one of four regions Moscow illegally annexed last month, and continues to see fierce clashes as Russian forces press their grinding attack on the cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka.A woman was killed after Russian rockets hit apartment buildings and a school in the southern city of Mykolayiv, its mayor reported Tuesday. Ukraine was still grappling with the consequences of Monday's massive barrage of Russian strikes, which disrupted power and water supplies. Zelenskyy announced Tuesday night that water supply had been restored nationwide, and that for the majority of the population, the same is true for electricity, although he said planned blackouts are still possible to protect the system in nine regions. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, subway service was suspended again on Tuesday, according to the subway's Telegram page. No reason was given.Separately, ships loaded with grain continued to depart Ukraine on Tuesday despite Russia's suspension of its participation in a U.N.-brokered deal to deliver critical food supplies to countries facing hunger. The U.N. said three ships carrying 84,490 metric tons of corn, wheat and sunflower meal left through a humanitarian sea corridor.Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Sony's quarterly profit through September rose 24 on healthy demand for its music and movies, prompting the Japanese entertainment and electronics company to raise its annual sales and profit forecasts Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File)TOKYO (AP) -- Sony said Tuesday its quarterly profit through September rose 24 on healthy demand for its music and movies, prompting the Japanese entertainment and electronics giant to raise its annual sales and profit forecasts. Tokyo-based Sony's July-September profit totaled 264 billion yen, or 1.8 billion, up from 213 billion yen in the previous year. Entertainment companies have tended to thrive during the pandemic, as people stuck at home turned to games and movies. Sony makes PlayStation video game consoles and also offers online gaming. Sony shipped 3.3 million PlayStation 5 game consoles during the second quarter of the April-March fiscal year. Although Sony's games business quarterly sales rose, its profit declined due to higher costs. Sony acquired U.S. video game developer Bungie during the quarter. In music, top-selling recordings included Beyonce's \"Renaissance\" and Harry Styles' \"Harry's House.\" Among its films, \"Bullet Train,\" starring Brad Pitt, earned 233 million globally. Sony, which also makes camcorders and headphones, recorded higher quarterly sales and profits for its imaging and sensor operations. Sony raised its sales forecast for the fiscal year through March 2023 to 11.6 trillion yen (79 billion) from an earlier projection of 11.5 trillion yen (78 billion). Sony's sales totaled 9.9 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sony also raised its fiscal year profit forecast to 840 billion yen (5.7 billion) from an earlier 800 billion yen (5.4 billion). That's lower than the 882 billion yen earned last year. Sony is among Japan's stellar brands, having brought the world the Walkman portable music player. But it had humble beginnings in the 1940s, when the nation was rebuilding from the ashes of World War II. In more recent decades, Sony's electronics division has faced tough competition from cheaper Asian rivals. Sales of TVs that were once pillars of Sony's power, for instance, have declined.

All Rights Reserved.US President Joe Biden on Tuesday lashed out at Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, zeroing in on a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender as he campaigned for Democrats facing uphill fights in next week's midterm election. (Nov. 2)MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Tuesday lashed out at Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis as \"Donald Trump incarnate,\" zeroing in on a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender as he campaigned for Democrats facing uphill fights in next week's midterm election.In a final-week sprint for Democrats before Election Day, Biden will campaign in New Mexico on Thursday, California on Friday and Pennsylvania on Saturday. By many accounts, Democratic control of Congress and several statehouses is in peril, and Biden is trying to stem that tide.In Florida, a state famously popular among retirees, he focused on federal programs for elderly people and the less well-to-do. He declared that the current crop of GOP candidates \"ain't your father's Republican party\" and said that he prayed God would deliver his opponents \"some enlightenment.\"After those remarks in Hallandale Beach, he headlined a fundraiser for gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist in Golden Beach. He capped his day in Florida with a rally at Florida Memorial University, a historically Black university, for the state's Democratic Party, including Crist and Senate candidate Val Demings.At the event for Crist, Biden made the stakes personal against DeSantis, a major adversary of the Biden White House. Biden suggested DeSantis was just another version of former President Trump and criticized him for \"demonizing the LGBTQ population.\"\"This to me is one of the most important races in the country,\" Biden said. \"Charlie is running against Donald Trump incarnate.\"Crist noted that DeSantis wouldn't commit at a gubernatorial debate last week to serving out his full four-year term if reelected.\"Governor DeSantis only cares about the White House, he doesn't give a damn about your house,\" Crist told the audience.The president's sharp attacks on DeSantis starkly contrasted with their cordial meeting earlier in October when Biden visited Florida to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. In front of the cameras, Biden said DeSantis was doing a \"good job\" handling the storm recovery. The Republican governor formally welcomed Biden to his state and praised the collaboration between officials on the ground and the federal government in Washington.But Tuesday in Florida, Biden took shots at DeSantis.At one point, during his evening remarks at Florida Memorial, Biden recalled that Crist -- who previously served as governor from 2007 to 2011 as a Republican -- \"was a great governor before and will make an even greater governor again because of who he is going to be replacing.\"Minutes later, Biden noted that the nearby Port of Miami recently received a 16 million federal grant due to one of his biggest legislative wins: the 1 trillion infrastructure legislation. He then pivoted toward DeSantis.\"I'm sure your governor will take credit for it somewhere along the line,\" Biden said.The president also blasted Republicans who made light of the attack against Paul Pelosi, the husband of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He asked how such a political assault could happen and \"nobody in that party condemns it for exactly what it is.\"In Hallandale Beach, he dinged Demings' Republican Senate opponent, incumbent Marco Rubio, for failing to back his Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August by the Democratic-led Congress.It includes several health care provisions popular among elderly people and the less well-off, including a 2,000 cap on out-of-pocket medical expenses and a 35 monthly cap per prescription of insulin. It requires companies that raise prices faster than overall inflation to pay Medicare a rebate.\"Not one single Republican voted for it in the United States Senate,\" Biden told a crowd at a Hallandale Beach community center. \"Every single solitary Republican in Congress voted against these savings, including Sen. Rubio.\"Biden's appearances with Crist and Demings came after some of the Democrats' most embattled candidates, including Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, have opted not to appear with him.Still, the president's advisers insist he can be helpful by talking about GOP policies they believe voters find objectionable.Meanwhile, Republicans are bullish on their prospects across Florida as voter registration trends and demographic shifts suggest the state will continue moving to the right. Democrats are particularly concerned about the trend in Miami-Dade County, home to 1.5 million Hispanics of voting age. It has been a Democratic stronghold for the past 20 years, but the GOP made significant gains in the past presidential election. Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, are predicting the region will turn red on Nov. 8. Should Democrats lose Miami-Dade, it could virtually eliminate their path to victory in statewide Florida contests, including presidential elections, moving forward.Biden has seized on Florida Sen. Rick Scott's February proposal to sunset all federal legislation after five years, which the president says would require Congress to reauthorize Medicare and Social Security, as emblematic of what he's termed the \"ultra-MAGA\" agenda Democrats are running against.Biden, who often ends his speech by asking, \"God to protect our troops\" offered a salty addendum with his remarks in Hallandale Beach.\"God, give some of our Republican friends some enlightenment,\" Biden said.Associated Press National Political Writer Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this story.Follow the AP's coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ian Walton)Baltimore Ravens place kicker Justin Tucker (9) celebrates with holder Jordan Stout (11) after kicking a field goal in the first half of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)DENVER (AP) -- Those who watch football for a living or for fun have been quick to rip Russell Wilson over his many cringe-worthy games, commercials, catch phrase deliveries and podium performances this season.Now, even his opponents are clowning the quarterback whose Denver Broncos are off to a 3-5 start just like Tom Brady's Buccaneers and Aaron Rodgers' Packers.The Baltimore Ravens kicked off Week 8 with a come-from-behind 27-22 win over Brady and the struggling Buccaneers on Thursday night and on the flight home, cornerback Marlon Humphrey busted out his phone for an Instagram livestream. When he panned to Justin Tucker, the kicker said, \"I heard Lamar (Jackson's) leading us in high knees: Ravens flock, let's fly!\"Those potshots  stemmed from Wilson telling reporters that he did high knees up and down the aisle while his teammates slept on their trans-Atlantic flight to London last week and Tucker's twist on Wilson's \" Let's Ride \" tagline the Broncos' new 245 milion QB had doggedly clung to even as his poor play continued and the losses, whispers -- and yells -- began piling up.Someone else on the Ravens' plane bellowed, \"Un-LIM-i-ted!\" ribbing Wilson over his notorious \" Mr. Unlimited \" video.About the only thing missing from the miles-high hilarity was a send-up of Wilson's cringy Subway commericals.\"But we've got to play him,\" Tucker quickly added. \"We respect him. We like him.\"The Ravens host the Broncos on Dec. 4.This piling on Wilson began in earnest with Richard Sherman relishing in his former teammate's horrible homecoming when the Broncos opened the season with a 17-16 loss at Seattle a few weeks after Keenan Allen joked about Wilson's \" Broncos Country, Let's Ride \" tagline that fans in Denver would quickly turn into \"Broncos Country, Let's Hide.\"Sherman continued the bashing after the Broncos' 12-9 loss to Indianapolis on the \"Thursday Night Football\" postgame show a month ago after Wilson was picked off in the end zone on a play in which the situation -- and Sherman -- screamed for a run. It was so reminiscent of Super Bowl 49 when Malcolm Butler's goal line interception of Wilson preserved New England's 28-24 win over the Seahawks that Sherman said he wished Marshawn Lynch was there with him to discuss the situation.Hall of Famers Troy Aikman and Kurt Warner have chimed in on Wilson's obdurate struggles. Warner's brutal 40-minute video breaking down Denver's multitude of problems followed Sherman's diatribe and placed the bulk of the blame for the Broncos' lurching offense on the QB.\"He's just got to be better and he's got to have a better overall understanding of what he's seeing and where different throws have to go,\" Warner said after that Indy loss. \"Can he get a little bit of help with the execution? Can he get a little bit of help with some of the play design? No doubt about it. But when you watch the film you see it: there are guys open all over the place; there are big plays to be had all over the place. \"You're not going to see many wins playing like this,\" warned Warner.Wilson followed up with a similarly bad game -- and Broncos rookie head coach Nathaniel Hackett followed up with an equally headscratching carbon copy of a game plan -- in a 19-16 overtime loss to the Chargers 11 days later.Wilson's strained hamstring kept him out of a 16-9 loss to the Jets in which backup Brett Rypien looked a lot like Russell, missing open targets with both his arm and his eyes.That hamstring, which forced him to miss just the fourth game of his 11-year career, was why Wilson said he spent most of the flight to London on his feet.The globe-trotting Wilson said he's immune from jet lag because he flies so much -- on his private plan on his own time -- that he's learned to avoid the consequences of long flights.\"The first two hours, I was watching film, watching all of the cutups and everything else. For the next four hours, I was doing treatment on the plane,\" Wilson explained. \"I was walking up and down the aisles. Everybody else was knocked out. I was doing high knees, working on my legs and everything else, and making sure that I'm ready to rock. \"That was good. Then the last two hours, I fell asleep for one hour and then I watched film the rest,\" Wilson said, adding that he stretches on flights \"when I need to. Especially on the longer flights, the more you move, the better you feel when you get off of it. I have my secrets; I have my movements and tons of water always helps.\"Hackett, who's been no stranger to the guff in his first crack at head coaching and who received a vote of confidence from his general manager last week, said he thinks Wilson is genuintely unbothered by the piling on.\"I mean, he's an amazing human being from that standpoint,\" Hackett said. \"Everybody says what they want. They say whatever they want. That's part of this game. It comes with the territory. \"As a head coach, as a quarterback, you're always going to get that, especially if you don't win, especially if the offense doesn't look good, like it hasn't.

All Rights Reserved.CEO of oil and gas company BP Bernard Looney talks during the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition  Conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili)LONDON (AP) -- BP's earnings more than doubled in the third quarter as the London-based energy giant benefited from high oil and natural gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Underlying replacement cost profit, which excludes one-time items and fluctuations in the value of inventories, jumped to 8.15 billion from 3.32 billion in the same period last year, BP said Tuesday. The company also announced plans to reward shareholders, buying back another 2.5 billion of stock. Soaring earnings at British energy companies are fueling calls for the government to expand a tax on their windfall profits as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak struggles to close an estimated 40 billion-pound (46 billion) hole in the budget. BP rival Shell last week said third-quarter earnings more than doubled to 9.45 billion.U.S. President Joe Biden also has floated the possibility of a windfall tax if energy companies don't boost domestic production, accusing them Monday of \"war profiteering.\"It comes as oil companies around the world are seeing earnings surge, with Saudi's Aramco on Tuesday reporting a 42.4 billion profit, it's second-highest quarterly earnings ever. Last week, Texas-based Exxon Mobil broke records with 19.66 billion in profits in the three months to September and California-based Chevron got close to its peak from last quarter with 11.23 billion.For BP, it is plowing some of the profits from high oil and natural gas prices into renewable energy as it tries to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050. During the third quarter, the company bought Archaea Energy, which produces natural gas from landfills and other waste sites across the U.S. and agreed to buy 40.5 of the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which plans to develop wind and solar power projects in Western Australia.\"This quarter's results reflect us continuing to perform while transforming,\" Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in a statement.Britain in May imposed an additional 25 tax on profits earned from oil and gas extraction in the U.K. The temporary tax is designed to raise about 5 billion pounds through the end of 2025. The new tax cost BP 778 million in the third quarter, the company said.The pressure on the U.K. government is likely to increase for a higher windfall tax.\"We need to raise more money from a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and actively encourage them to invest in renewables,\" said Alok Sharma, who chaired COP26, the last U.N. climate summit.BP's earnings jumped as Brent crude, a benchmark for European oil prices, averaged 100.84 a barrel in the third quarter, 37 higher than during the same period last year. Natural gas prices have been even more volatile as Russia curtails supplies to Europe. In the U.K., wholesale gas prices averaged 137 higher than a year earlier.Although prices have fallen in recent weeks, BP said it expects them to remain high during the fourth quarter after the OPEC group of oil-exporting nations cut production and as Russia limits gas supplies.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - A visitor sets up his camera in the Victoria Peak area to photograph Hong Kong's skyline, Sept. 1, 2019. A tropic storm and absences of VIP guests have cast a shadow over Wednesday's planned financial conference meant to help Hong Kong restore its image as a financial hub and destination for business travel. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)HONG KONG (AP) -- A tropical storm and absences of VIP guests have cast a shadow over a financial conference meant to help Hong Kong restore its image as a financial hub and destination for business travel. The first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions was due to begin Wednesday. But at least four top executives from institutions including the CEOs of Citigroup and Barclays, who had been expected to attend the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, were dropping out. The Hong Kong Observatory forecast that tropical storm Nalgae would likely bring torrential rains as it passes 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the southwest, in further bad news for organizers of the meeting. At least four top finance executives initially slated to attend the conference this week have dropped out. They include Blackstone Inc. President Jonathan Gray and Citigroup Inc.'s CEO Jane Fraser, who will no longer attend the conference after contracting COVID-19. The CEO of Barclays, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, also scrapped plans to go. Gray was slated to speak in a panel on global uncertainty, while Fraser was supposed to discuss sustainable finance.On Tuesday, Capital Group Cos.' CEO Timothy Armour became the latest chief executive to withdraw from the conference, for health reasons.The city's T3 strong wind signal was in force Tuesday, with the possibility a higher signal might be raised, depending on the storm. Typically, most businesses close and events are postponed if a T8 strong wind signal is raised. But the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, organizer of the summit, said it would go ahead even if the T8 signal is hoisted. The main events of the conference take place Wednesday.Authorities have pulled out all the stops for the gathering, tailoring restrictions for participants such as allowing them to dine in at specific restaurants, even as most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city. Other restrictions include allowing attendees who test positive for COVID-19 to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.Hong Kong leader John Lee said during a news conference Tuesday that it was to be a \"vibrant\" week for Hong Kong.When asked if the restrictions designed for conference participants constituted a \"double standard,\" Lee said different plans are formulated to ensure activities can go ahead.\"It's on these principles that we put in place certain measures so that some major events can go ahead in Hong Kong,\" he said.Illustrating the impatience in Hong Kong for a reopening on the neighboring Chinese mainland, the city's benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 5.2 on Tuesday following unconfirmed rumors that China may be beginning to plan to dismantle its stringent COVID-19 controls, which involve mass testing and sometimes lock-downs of entire neighborhoods or cities. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters he was \"not aware of what you just mentioned\" when asked about the rumor. Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about a crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong after the semi-autonomous territory implemented its National Security Law.Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Jim McGovern, who chair the Congressional Executive Commission on China, urged financial executives to reconsider their decision to attend the Hong Kong event. \"Their presence only serves to legitimize the swift dismantling of Hong Kong's autonomy, free press, and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party,\" they said in a statement.After loosening its once strict pandemic precautions, Hong Kong is trying to get back on track as a destination for all kinds of tourism. The former British colony is due to hold the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament from Nov. 4-6, for the first since the pandemic began. The city's is also holding a five-day \"FinTech Week,\" with hundreds of exhibitors and speakers and an expected total turnout of thousands.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Peter Morrison, File)ROME (AP) -- Spain's Pedri Gonzalez will highlight the list of teenagers who could make an impact at the World Cup. Others include England's Jude Bellingham, Germany's Jamal Musiala and American teammates Gio Reyna and Yunus Musah.All five players are 19, although Reyna turns 20 on Nov. 13 and Pedri and Musah will both turn 20 during the tournament in Qatar.The World Cup opens on Nov. 20 and the final is set for Dec. 18.PEDRI GONZALEZ (Spain)Like his childhood idol Andres Iniesta, Pedri is becoming a fixture in midfield for both Barcelona and Spain. While he does score goals occasionally, it's Pedri's passing and footwork with the ball that set him apart -- just like Iniesta. \"I always loved Iniesta and his way of playing soccer, because of how he was both on and off the field,\" Pedri told The Associated Press in an interview last year. \"He has been my reference and I have tried to model myself on him.\" A member of Spain's team that lost last year's Olympic final to Brazil, Pedri will attempt to help his squad go one step further in Qatar.JUDE BELLINGHAM (England)While playing for Borussia Dortmund in October, Bellingham became the third teenager to score in four consecutive Champions League appearances after Erling Haaland (five appearances ending in November 2019) and Kylian Mbappe (four appearances ending in April 2017) -- with one significant difference: Bellingham is a midfielder, not a striker like Haaland and Mbappe. That's because Bellingham is able to use his 6-foot-1 (1.86-meter) frame to muscle off opposing players both while defending and attacking. A strong World Cup will only increase Bellingham's price on the transfer market, as he'll be expected to follow Robert Lewandowski's and Haaland's examples and leave Dortmund for one of Europe's top clubs after this season.JAMAL MUSIALA (Germany)Able to play any position in midfield, Musiala could be the key to Germany's revival following a group-stage exit four years ago in Russia as defending champion. Born in Germany to a Nigerian father and a German mother but raised mostly in England -- the team he played for at the under-21 level -- Musiala said he \"just listened to my feelings\" when he decided to represent Germany at the senior level. Already known for his passing skills, Musiala is also showing off his scoring abilities this season with eight goals in 15 appearances in all competitions for Bayern Munich. His impact was witnessed when he was involved in three of the four goals in Bayern's 4-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen in September.GIO REYNA (United States)The son of former United States captain Claudio Reyna never saw his dad play for the national team. That's because Gio was too young when Claudio made his last national team appearance in a 2006 World Cup loss to Ghana. His mother, Danielle Egan Reyna, also played for the United States briefly in 2003. An attacking midfielder or winger, the younger Reyna is back in form following an injury-plagued 2021-22 season. He curled a strike inside the far post for Borussia Dortmund in a win over Stuttgart in the German league last month. Reyna's previous appearance against Stuttgart had ended when he sustained a muscle and tendon injury just after kickoff -- ending last season prematurely in April.YUNUS MUSAH (United States)Born in the United States to Ghanaian parents, Musah grew up mostly in Britain and played for England's youth teams before ultimately deciding to represent his birth nation. A midfielder, Musah helped Spanish club Valencia to last season's Copa del Rey final but was the only player to miss his spot kick in a penalty shootout, which led to Real Betis winning the trophy. Having recently returned from a groin injury, Musah is a first-choice midfielder for United States coach Gregg Berhalter, along with Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie.Slightly older players who appear ready for breakout performances include Alphonso Davies of Canada, Rafael Leao of Portugal, Boulaye Dia of Senegal, Kim Min-jae of South Korea and Mohammed Kudus of Ghana.Born in a Ghana refugee camp to Liberian parents, Davies, who turns 22 on Nov. 2, is a regular at left back or on the wing for Bayern Munich. He made a big impact in helping Canada qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.The 23-year-old Leao was instrumental in helping AC Milan win the Serie A title last season and has been even better in the Italian league this campaign. With Rafa Silva having recently announced his retirement from Portugal's national team, Leao will likely be Cristiano Ronaldo's preferred strike partner in Qatar.Among the early high scorers in Serie A with Salernitana this season (on loan from Villarreal), Dia worked as an electrician before his soccer career took off. He scored against Liverpool in the semifinals of last season's Champions League.Napoli fans protested when defensive stalwart Kalidou Koulibaly was sold to Chelsea and the lesser-known Kim was brought in as a replacement at center back. But Kim has been a big part of Napoli's sensational start to the Italian league and was named Serie A player of the month for September.An attacking midfielder, the 22-year-old Kudus had scored nine goals in 16 appearances for Ajax in all competitions by the end of October.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsAndrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampfCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar, File)FILE - North Carolina forward Armando Bacot (5) dunks against Duke during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Saturday, Feb. 5, 2022, in Chapel Hill, N.C. Bacot was named to The Associated Press preseason All-America team, Monday, Oct. 24, 2022.(AP Photo/Chris Seward, File)FILE -- Tennessee guard Josiah-Jordan James reacts to fans as he walks off the court at the end of a college basketball game against Longwood in the first round of the NCAA tournament in Indianapolis, March 17, 2022. Last March, the Volunteers won the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship for the first time since 1979 and finished fifth in the final AP Top 25 poll. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)Arguments over conference supremacy have begun well before the start of the college basketball season.Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim offered one of the most quotable remarks of the preseason when he pointed out the Big Ten's failings in the postseason.\"At the end of the day, you play for the tournament,\" Boeheim said. \"That's what you play for. It's simple. You can say all you want about the Big Ten. They sucked in the tournament. So to me, that's what they did. I don't care what they did in the regular season.\"The Big Ten led all conferences with nine NCAA Tournament bids last season but sent only two teams ( Michigan and Purdue ) to regional semifinals and didn't have anyone last beyond the Sweet 16. Syracuse plays in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which got five bids but sent three teams to the Sweet 16 and had North Carolina and Duke reach the Final Four.One year earlier, the Big Ten had nine NCAA Tournament bids to again lead all leagues but advanced only Michigan beyond the round of 32.\"That's what you play for, to get in the tournament and to win in the tournament,\" Boeheim said. \"If you don't do that, then you're not good.\"As we rank the top six conferences for the upcoming season, we don't give the No. 1 spot to either the Big Ten or the ACC. That honor instead goes to the league that has produced the last two NCAA Tournament champions.The Big 12 kept its hold on the national title when Kansas won last season after Baylor earned the crown a year earlier. The Big 12 nearly had three straight championships by three different schools, as Texas Tech lost the 2019 championship game to Virginia in overtime. The Big 12 has five teams in the preseason Associated Press Top 25. Kansas and Baylor are tied for fifth. The other ranked teams are No. 12 Texas, No. 14 TCU and No. 25 Texas Tech.A look at the preseason Top 25 indicates the SEC could emerge as the best conference of all. The SEC has five ranked teams, all in the top 20: No. 4 Kentucky, No. 10 Arkansas, No. 11 Tennessee, No. 15 Auburn and No. 20 Alabama. Arkansas, Alabama and Kentucky brought in three of the nation's top five freshman classes according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports. Kentucky's Oscar Tschiebwe was the consensus national player of the year last season.The ACC has the nation's top-ranked team in North Carolina, which returns preseason AP All-America selection Armando Bacot from a team that lost to Kansas in last season's championship game. No. 7 Duke begins the post-Mike Krzyzewski era by welcoming in new coach Jon Scheyer and the nation's top-ranked recruiting class. The only other ACC team in the preseason Top 25 is No. 18 Virginia.The Big Ten figures to take a step back this season after having three players (Iowa's Keegan Murray, Purdue's Jaden Ivey and Wisconsin's Johnny Davis) among the top 10 picks in the NBA draft. No. 13 Indiana is the only Big Ten team ranked higher than 22nd in the preseason Top 25. The league's only other ranked teams are No. 22 Michigan and No. 23 Illinois. Perhaps this is the year the Big Ten gets fewer NCAA Tournament bids but ends up lasting longer in the tournament.The Pac-12 sent just three teams to the NCAA Tournament despite benefiting from the resurgence of Arizona in coach Tommy Lloyd's debut season. The Pac-12 heads into this season with three ranked teams in No. 8 UCLA, No. 17 Arizona and No. 21 Oregon.The retirement of Villanova coach Jay Wright could shake things up in this league. No. 9 Creighton is the preseason pick to win the Big East by the league's coaches, the first time the Bluejays have had that honor since joining the conference for the 2013-14 season. The only other ranked Big East team is No. 16 Villanova under first-year coach Kyle Neptune. Providence must replace all five starters from the team that won last year's Big East title.More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Ford plans to employ about 6,000 workers at the plant, while construction of the factory and the arrival of Ford suppliers will create thousands more jobs. Ford has said it plans to start production by 2025.Grants will range between 25,000 and 100,000 and are available in Haywood, Fayette, Tipton, Lauderdale, Shelby and Madison counties.

All Rights Reserved.New research shows vaccinating pregnant women helped protect their newborns from the common but scary respiratory virus called RSV that fills hospitals with wheezing babies each fall. (Nov. 1)New research shows vaccinating pregnant women helped protect their newborns from the common but scary respiratory virus called RSV that fills hospitals with wheezing babies each fall.The preliminary results buoy hope that after decades of failure and frustration, vaccines against RSV may finally be getting close. Pfizer announced Tuesday that a large international study found vaccinating moms-to-be was nearly 82 effective at preventing severe cases of RSV in their babies' most vulnerable first 90 days of life. At age 6 months, the vaccine still was proving 69 effective against serious illness -- and there were no signs of safety problems in mothers or babies. \"Moms are always giving their antibodies to their baby,\" said virologist Kena Swanson, Pfizer's vice president of viral vaccines. \"The vaccine just puts them in that much better position\" to form and pass on RSV-fighting antibodies.The vaccine quest isn't just to protect infants. RSV is dangerous for older adults, too, and both Pfizer and rival GSK recently announced that their competing shots also proved protective for seniors. None of the findings will help this year when an early RSV surge already is crowding children's hospitals. But they raise the prospect that one or more vaccines might become available before next fall's RSV season.\"My fingers are crossed,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. \"We're making inroads.\"Tuesday's data was reported in a press release and hasn't been vetted by independent experts.Here's a look at the long quest for RSV vaccines.For most healthy people, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a cold-like nuisance. But for the very young, the elderly and people with certain health problems, it can be serious, even life-threatening. The virus can infect deep in the lungs, causing pneumonia, and in babies it can impede breathing by inflaming tiny airways.In the U.S., about 58,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized for RSV each year and several hundred die. Among adults 65 and older, about 177,000 are hospitalized with RSV and 14,000 die annually.Worldwide, RSV kills about 100,000 children a year, mostly in poor countries. A tragedy in the 1960s set back the whole field. Using the approach that led to the first polio vaccine, scientists made an experimental RSV vaccine by growing the virus in a lab and killing it. But testing in children found not only was the vaccine not protective, youngsters who caught RSV after vaccination fared worse. Two died.\"For a period of 20 years, even though science was advancing, nobody wanted to go near development of an RSV vaccine,\" Schaffner said. Even today's modern RSV vaccine candidates were tested first in older adults, not children, he noted.Modern vaccines tend to target the outer surface of a virus, what the immune system sees when a germ invades. For RSV, that target is the so-called F protein that helps the virus latch onto human cells. Again there was a hurdle: That protein is a shape-shifter, rearranging its form before and after it \"fuses\" to cells. It turns out that the immune system only forms effective RSV-fighting antibodies when it spots what's called the pre-fusion version of that protein, explained structural biologist Jason McLellan of the University of Texas at Austin.In 2013, McLellan and virologist Barney Graham were working at the National Institutes of Health when they homed in on the correct shape and figured out how to freeze it in that form. That finding opened the way to today's development of a variety of experimental RSV vaccine candidates.(That same discovery was key to the hugely successful COVID-19 vaccines, as the coronavirus also is cloaked in a shape-shifting surface protein.)Several companies are creating RSV vaccines but Pfizer and rival GSK are furthest along. Both companies recently reported final-stage testing in older adults. The competing vaccines are made somewhat differently but each proved strongly effective, especially against serious disease. Both companies plan to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. by the end of the year, as well as in other countries.The older-adult data \"looks fantastic,\" said McLellan, who has closely followed the vaccine development. \"I think we're on the right track.\"And if vaccinating pregnant women pans out, it could be \"a win for two individuals instead of just one,\" by offering protection to both mom-to-be and baby, said Dr. Wilbur Chen of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Pfizer's maternal vaccine is the same recipe that it tested successfully in older adults -- and it also plans to seek Food and Drug Administration approval for those vaccinations by year's end. The new study included 7,400 pregnant women in 18 countries, including the U.S., and spanned multiple RSV seasons. Preliminary results reported Tuesday show the vaccine was most effective against severe disease. For milder illness, effectiveness was 51 to 57 -- short of the study's statistical requirements but a result that Pfizer still called clinically meaningful because it could mean fewer trips to the doctor's office.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - The Johnson  Johnson logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, July 12, 2021. Johnson  Johnson is spending about 16.6 billion to buy cardiovascular technology company Abiomed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, and build up its medical device division. The health care giant says it will pay 380 for each Biomed share and also provide another 35 per share in cash if some commercial and clinical milestones are met. Abiomed provides technology that treats coronary artery disease and heart failure. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, file)Johnson  Johnson is spending more than 16 billion to move deeper into treating heart disease and continue a shift started last year away from its consumer health roots.The health care giant said Tuesday that it will buy the cardiovascular technology company Abiomed, which makes a heart pump used on patients with severe coronary artery disease. The deal is expected to close early next year and will bolster JJ's MedTech or medical device division. That's one of two remaining segments, along with pharmaceuticals, that the company is focused on after announcing that it would split off its consumer health division that sells Band Aids and beauty products. The deal for Danvers, Massachusetts-based Abiomed will complement JJ's existing heart business and comes with \"significant\" expansion opportunities, CEO Joaquin Duato told analysts during a Tuesday morning conference call. It also adds to JJ's portfolio a company with explosive growth. Abiomed sales jumped 22 to exceed 1 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That is well over twice the annual sales it booked just five years ago. JJ's BioSense business focuses on treating arrhythmia or an irregular heartbeat. Abiomed will add, among other products, its Impella heart pumps, which are inserted through arteries into the hearts of high-risk patients. They temporarily help the heart maintain blood flow while a surgeon places stents in the patient.  Abiomed will run as a stand-alone business within JJ's medical device segment once the deal is completed. JJ said it will pay 380 in cash for each Abiomed share. It also will throw in another 35 per share in cash if some commercial and clinical milestones are met in a few years. JJ will pay for the deal with a combination of cash and short-term financing. The company expects the acquisition to be neutral or to slightly dilute adjusted earnings in the first year after its completion. It then expects that the deal will help its bottom line starting in 2024.The deal comes a few weeks after JJ said it topped third-quarter expectations, thanks to growth from its largest segment, pharmaceuticals. Sales climbed 2 in the company's medical device segment, to 6.78 billion.Shares of Johnson  Johnson, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, slipped nearly a dollar to 173.11 in Tuesday morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which JJ is a component, rose slightly.Shares of Abiomed Inc. soared more than 50 to 380.

Naseema and seven members of her family were walking on the congested suspension bridge when its cables gave away, sending them all plunging head-first into the wide Machchu river. She lost her daughter Muskan, 21, two nephews, two nieces and two sister-in-laws that night. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)MORBI, India (AP) -- Naseema Ben Shamdar and seven members of her family were making their way across Morbi's jam-packed suspension bridge when its cables gave way Sunday, plunging them into the deep, wide waters of Machchu river and killing 134 people. In just seconds, Naseema was gasping for breath and trying desperately to swim to shore, struggling through a quagmire of mud and weeds. All around her, people were pleading for help. Some of those who fell into the river were stuck in its deep silt. Some were knocked unconscious by the aluminum walkway that crashed into the water along with the hundreds of people who had been walking on it. Many tried to climb cables dangling into the water, sometimes losing their grip and falling on others mired in the murky water.The disaster in Morbi is one of India's worst in years. The collapse of the pedestrian bridge while it was crowded with hundreds of holiday goers has raised questions about why the 143-year-old landmark, touted as an artistic and engineering marvel, failed just four days after reopening after months of repairs. Police arrested nine people, including managers of the bridge's operator, Oreva Group, as they began investigating the catastrophe. In Morbi, shock and anger were overtaken by mourning and grief. Friends have lost friends and parents have lost children. In many cases, families have lost several members.When she surfaced, Naseema could only think of her 21-year-old daughter, Muskan, who was nowhere in sight.\"One moment she was there with me and the next she was gone. She just disappeared in the water,\" Naseema said Tuesday at her home in Morbi. By the time rescuers pulled Naseema to safety, the river had consumed every other family member who had been on the bridge that evening. She lost her daughter, her two nephews, two nieces and two sisters-in-law.\"We were eight family members there and now I am the only one left alive,\" Naseema said, her voice choking with tears. \"Everyone is gone.\"\"Everyone I loved is dead,\" said Arif Shamdar, a painter. He said that like many others, his daughter and son were excited to visit the bridge and watch the sunset. He stayed behind, asking his wife Aneesa to keep the children, Aliya and Afreed, safe because he expected a huge crowd.Barely an hour later, a relative called Shamdar, telling him of the disaster. Rushing to the site, he saw the bridge snapped in two, its metal walkway dangling. Banks on both sides of the river were strewn with bodies. For five hours, Shamdar scoured the waters searching for his family. He swam to the middle of the river. He got on an inflatable raft and screamed their names. Crestfallen and anxious, he rushed to a nearby hospital where he saw his two children lying dead on stretchers. His wife was on the floor, also dead.\"I screamed and screamed and asked doctors to help. But there was nothing they could do. My family had already been dead for hours,\" Shamdar said.Hundreds of people gathered in his neighborhood Monday for the funeral. His wife, two children, and his niece Muskan were buried in the local graveyard. Three other family members were buried in an ancestral burial ground in a nearby town.In the town's crematoriums and burial grounds, workers said they had never seen so many dead brought for final rites on a single day.\"I have never seen anything like this in my life,\" said Gaffar Shah, caretaker of the main Muslim graveyard in Morbi. He helped bury 25 bodies on Monday. \"Entire families have been wiped out,\" he said. All through Morbi, a city famed for its ceramics and clock industries, friends, relatives and neighbors gathered in the homes of the mourning, emerging from the town's narrow lanes in twos and threes.\"We are devastated,\" said Raydhan Bhai, whose two nephews drowned in disaster. Yash Devadana, 12, and Raj Bhagwanji Bhai, 13, were cousins who lived in the same house. They were good friends, too, their relatives said, always playing together and often swimming in the river.On Sunday, the two cousins left for the bridge hand in hand. By midnight, they were both dead, having perished in those same waters. As mourners sat beside garlanded photo frames of Yash and Raj on Tuesday, Raydhan Bhai pointed to Yash's pet dog. It hasn't eaten, waiting for Yash to return, he said.\"Yash loved the dog and even slept with it in his bed,\" Raydhan Bhai said. \"Even his pet has felt Yash's absence.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

A new campaign in France allows young children to flag abusive attacks by simply dropping letters in easily accessible mailboxes across the country, for experts to assess. And the results have led to several police investigations, while giving a rare and shocking snapshot of the scale of child abuse in France. (Association Les Papillons via AP)PARIS (AP) -- A new campaign in France allows young children to flag abusive attacks by simply dropping letters in easily accessible mailboxes across the country, for experts to assess. And the results have led to several police investigations, while giving a rare and shocking snapshot of the scale of child abuse in France.Started by a police officer who was himself sexually abused as a boy and founded a child protection group called Les Papillons (\"Butterflies\"), the two-year-old program runs under the motto: \"If you can't say it, write it.\"Most of the written messages deposited over the past year in the 200 white boxes set up in primary schools, sports clubs and other places accessible to some 61,000 children, refer to insults, mockery, and psychological aggression.But 13 concerns school bullying, 21 physical abuse, and 7 sexual abuse. In the latter group, 30 occurred within the family circle and 70 concerned girls. \"It's useful for some children who cannot get to speak out loud of painful things, or who don't know whom to talk to,\" said Florence, the principal of a school for 3- to 10-year-olds in a rural area of eastern France.\"It's very difficult to speak about sexual abuse, especially if that's about someone in or close to the family -- whereas the mailbox is neutral,\" she stressed. She asked The Associated Press not to use her full name, to protect the privacy of the children involved.About half the complaints are from children aged 8-9, and over 15 are aged 6-7, given that the majority of mailboxes are placed in primary schools and most young kids don't have a mobile phone to call the 119 official helpline for abused children.Police officer Laurent Boyet, head of Les Papillons, said the initiative helps home in on an issue that is difficult to detect in official statistics.In projections based on the past year's responses, the group calculated that out of the country's 12 million preschool to high school students there could be an estimated 840,000 victims of sexual abuse, including 240,000 cases of incest.\"The great strength of (the) process is that it's based on the children's words ... There's no adult interfering,\" Boyet stressed. Boyet wrote a book in 2017 to tell his own story. He said he was raped by his brother, who was 10 years older, when he was between the ages of 6 and 9.\"I know from having been a victim myself: the aggressor forbids (children) to speak ... But no one tells you that you cannot write,\" he said. \"And writing, you can do it quietly in your bedroom.\"Each time a mailbox is installed, Boyet said, explanations are provided to children about the project. A person of trust is designated to pick up the letters at least twice a week. Messages are then assessed by a team of 12 volunteers, all professionals in the field of children's issues, including psychologists and educators.About 5 of the cases have been reported to the local authorities' child maltreatment units in charge of taking necessary measures.And 1.6 of the messages have been immediately reported to prosecutors, leading to a police investigation, in line with French law regarding \"serious and imminent danger\" to children. They include all alleged sexual abuses.It happened in the school where Florence is the principal after a mailbox was set up there when she heard about the initiative from one of the association's volunteers.\"It seemed interesting,\" she said. \"I thought there were not many issues in my school so, at the beginning, it was more to clear my conscience. I thought that it wouldn't hurt. As it turns out, there were some needs.\" Florence.In June, on the very first day the mailbox was set up, a 10-year-old girl left a message naming her grandfather, and describing what appeared to have been instances of incestuous rape. A few days later, police officers confirmed that she and two other girls in her family had allegedly been victims of incest for years.This was a \"tragic\" situation, Florence recalled. \"In the end, the parents thanked us because it helped their daughter to escape a sexual predator.\" The suspected aggressor is now in prison pending trial.Boyet stressed that almost all children take the mailboxes seriously and that malicious or made-up accusations are \"extremely rare.\" Only 2 of the messages in the mailboxes are anonymous and almost none are irrelevant, he added.Before the 2000s, France did not have specific national surveys on interpersonal violence. And it was not until 2015 that a large survey provided a better understanding of violence during childhood. Carried out by the French Institute of Demographic Studies, Ined, it provided estimates of sexual abuse under the age of 18, based on a sample of nearly 27,000 adult women and men. It showed that 4 of women and O,4 of men said they experienced unwanted sexual touching, while rapes and rape attempts have been reported by 1,5 of women and 0.3 of men.Boyet said he was not surprised by the figures resulting from the Papillons initiative showing the extent of child abuse. \"It strengthened my conviction in the sense that figures we usually use, we know they are under-estimated,\" he said. \"That's what gives meaning to the work we are doing.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Petty Officer 3rd Class Hunter Schnabel/U.S. Coast Guard via AP)This summer, as China fired missiles into the sea off Taiwan to protest House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island, a much different kind of geopolitical standoff was taking shape in another corner of the Pacific Ocean.Thousands of miles away, a heavily-armed U.S. Coast Guard cutter sailed up to a fleet of a few hundred Chinese squid-fishing boats not far from Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. Its mission: inspect the vessels for any signs of illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. Boarding ships on the high seas is a perfectly legal if little-used tool available to any sea power as part of the collective effort to protect the oceans' threatened fish stocks. But in this case, the Chinese captains of several fishing boats did something unexpected. Three vessels sped away, one turning aggressively 90 degrees toward the Coast Guard cutter James, forcing the American vessel to take evasive action to avoid being rammed. \"For the most part they wanted to avoid us,\" said Coast Guard Lt. Hunter Stowes, the highest-ranking law enforcement officer on the James. \"But we were able to maneuver effectively so that we were safe the entire time.\" Still, the high-seas confrontation represented a potentially dangerous breach of international maritime protocol, one the U.S. sees as a troubling precedent since it happened on the Coast Guard's first-ever mission to counter illegal fishing in the eastern Pacific.The Associated Press reconstructed details of the never-before-reported incident from the Coast Guard and six U.S. non-military officials who spoke of the operation in greater detail but requested anonymity to avoid jeopardizing a multilateral process seeking to force China to sanction the vessels. While diplomats in China accused the Americans of acting improperly, they didn't provide their own detailed account.The Coast Guard's unprecedented voyage was prompted by growing alarm from activists and governments in Latin America over the activities of China's distant water fishing fleet, the world's largest. Since 2009, the number of Chinese-flagged vessels spotted fishing in the south Pacific, sometimes for months at a time, has surged eightfold, to 476 last year. Meanwhile, the size of its squid catch has grown from 70,000 tons to 422,000 -- a level of fishing that some scientists fear is unsustainable even for a resilient species. As revealed in an AP-Univision investigation last year, the Chinese flotilla includes some of the seafood industry's worst offenders, with long records of labor abuse, illegal fishing and violations of maritime law. But they're being drawn to the open ocean around the Americas -- where the U.S. has long dominated -- after depleting fish stocks closer to home and fueled by an increasingly fierce race between the two superpowers to secure access to the world's dwindling natural resources.The illegal fishing patrol, which took place over 10 days in August, was initially kept quiet. The Coast Guard, more than a month later, released a brief statement celebrating the mission along with photos from two ships it did manage to successfully board. But it made no mention of the three that ran away or gave any clue to the vessels' nationality - a posture the Coast Guard maintained in its conversations with the AP.But the incident didn't go unnoticed in China.Within days, Beijing fired off a formal written protest, according to the U.S. officials. Additionally, the issue was raised when U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns was summoned by China's foreign ministry for an emergency meeting over Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, one of the officials said.China's foreign ministry told the AP that it has zero tolerance for illegal fishing and said it was the U.S. that is flouting international norms by carrying out unauthorized inspections that don't follow COVID protocols, potentially putting seafarers' lives at risk.\"The behavior of the United States is unsafe, opaque and unprofessional,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement to the AP. \"We demand that the U.S. side stop its dangerous and erroneous inspection activities.\"The Coast Guard disputes that assertion, saying all members of the boarding team, in addition to being vaccinated, were wearing masks, gloves and long sleeves. The Biden administration also reported possible violations discovered on the two boats it did inspect to the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization, or SPRFMO, a group of 16 members -- including China and the U.S. -- charged with ensuring sustainable fishing in 53 million square kilometers of ocean.One of the most serious accusations is against the Yong Hang 3, a refrigerated cargo vessel used to transport fish back to China so that smaller vessels can stay on the water for longer periods. The vessel was among those that ran from the Coast Guard patrol, disobeying direct orders to cooperate from maritime authorities in Panama, to which the vessel was flagged. To obscure activities, some vessels, especially refrigerated cargo vessels, often fly under other flags but are named, managed and docked in China. Ultimately, if history is any guide, China's communist government is unlikely to punish a fleet of 3,000 distant water fishing vessels it views as an extension of its growing naval prowess and promotes with generous state loans and fuel subsidies.The Coast Guard's patrol was meticulously planned, according to Lt. Stowes. The United States warned fisheries officials more than a year ago that it intended to conduct boardings in the area and filed papers showing pictures of the badges the crew would be carrying as well as the blue-and-white checkered flag the cutter would be hoisting. Five other countries, including Chile and New Zealand, have filed similar paperwork under rules allowing members fishing in the south Pacific to inspect each others' vessels.\"Just our being out there and doing the boardings really makes a statement,\" Stowes said. At-sea inspections are considered a vital tool to verify that fishing vessels are following rules regarding the use of forced labor, environmentally hazardous gear and the targeting of threatened species such as sharks. China has repeatedly blocked efforts to strengthen inspection procedures in the south Pacific. The most recent stonewalling took place last year, when China argued that fishermen would be at risk if at-sea patrols were allowed to carry firearms.Rules adopted unanimously in 2011 are guided by a 1995 United Nations treaty, known as the Fish Stocks Agreement, that allows inspectors to use limited force to stay safe.In a sign of how geopolitical rivalry may be escalating since the Pacific incident, one official told AP that the State Department sent a sternly-worded diplomatic note reminding Beijing of its international obligations as well as the distant water fleet's long track record of labor abuses and violations. The Biden administration is also weighing whether it will seek to have the vessels blacklisted for illegal fishing and banned from returning to the south Pacific at an upcoming meeting in Ecuador of the fishing management organization.This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

On Thursday, Oct. 20, 2022, Pfizer said it will charge 110 to 130 for a dose of its COVID-19 vaccine once the U.S. government stops buying the shots, but the drugmaker says it expects many people will continue receiving doses for free.

A federal appeals court in New Orleans on Monday, Oct. 3, 2022, became the latest to hear arguments on whether President Joe Biden overstepped his authority with an order that federal contractors require that their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment helped the pharmaceutical giant balance tumbling international sales for its coronavirus vaccine and top third-quarter expectations.The pill treatment Paxlovid brought in 7.5 billion in sales in the quarter and has generated more than 17 billion so far this year.Sales from the vaccine Comirnaty, meanwhile, tumbled 66 to 4.4 billion in the quarter. That was mainly due to changes in a European Commission supply agreement that pushed dose deliveries into the fourth quarter. Sales also were hurt by slow demand in emerging markets. But vaccine sales jumped in the United States after regulators approved a new booster dose and expanded access to children as young as 6 months old. Pfizer books the vast majority of revenue from Comirnaty and splits profit, as well as the cost to make and distribute the vaccine, with German development partner BioNTech.Pfizer's top-selling COVID-19 vaccine and treatment generated more than half the company's revenue in third quarter. Sales for both are expected to trail off in the coming years but still amount to billions of dollars annually. Pfizer also faces the expiration in the next several years of patents protecting key products from cheaper generic competition. Those include the breast cancer drug Ibrance and Eliquis, for preventing blood clots and strokes.Company leaders emphasized during a Tuesday call with analysts that they are making progress addressing those future revenue challenges through a combination of acquisitions and drug development. Pfizer also said Tuesday that a large international study found vaccinating moms-to-be was nearly 82 effective at preventing severe cases of RSV, the common but scary respiratory virus, in their babies' most vulnerable first 90 days of life. Pfizer executives said Tuesday that vaccine could hit the market late next year, depending on regulatory approvals, and could become another multi-billion dollar sales generator.Overall, Pfizer's profit jumped 6 to 8.61 billion in the third quarter, and adjusted earnings totaled 1.78 per share. That easily topped analyst expectations of 1.39, according to a survey by FactSet. Revenue slid 6 to 22.64 billion as the strong dollar dented international sales, but Pfizer's top line also beat Wall Street projections, which were for 21.07 billion in sales.Pfizer Inc., based in New York, also raised and narrowed its 2022 earnings forecast. It now expects adjusted earnings to range between 6.40 and 6.50 per share.Analysts forecast earnings of 6.40 per share.Company shares jumped more than 2, or 1.09, to 47.64 in late-morning trading while broader indexes slipped.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government on Tuesday began issuing certificates recognizing same-sex couples in the Japanese capital, a small improvement toward greater awareness of sexual diversity in a country where same-sex marriage is not allowed. (AP Photo/Mari Yamaguchi)TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's capital, Tokyo, began issuing certificates recognizing same-sex couples on Tuesday, becoming the largest municipality to do so in a country in which same-sex marriage is not allowed.Seven years after Tokyo's Shibuya district first introduced same-sex partnership recognition in 2015, more than 200 smaller towns have joined the move, accounting for less than one-fifth of Japanese municipalities. The certificates are not legally binding but allow same-sex partners to apply for public housing like married couples, give them access to medical data and allow them to be beneficiaries in auto and life insurance. Support for sexual diversity has grown slowly in Japan, and legal protections are still lacking for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They often face discrimination at school, work and at home, causing many to hide their sexual identities. Still, many sexual minority couples say the partnership recognition will improve their daily lives, allowing them to rent apartments and sign documents in medical emergencies, and in inheritance.\"With this (certificate), there is no need to explain, and I think I will be able to talk to other people about the relationship between myself and my partner with a bit more confidence,\" said Soyoka Yamamoto, who campaigned for same-sex partnership recognition by Tokyo.She said she has worried constantly about discrimination and had to make an extra effort in explaining her relationship with her partner. A certificate recognizing their partnership was issued Tuesday with Gov. Yuriko Koike's signature. Her partner, Yoriko, who uses only her first name, also welcomed the certificate, saying it \"publicly recognizes our relationship for the first time after we have lived together for more than 10 years.\"Same-sex couples are often barred from jointly renting apartments, visiting each other in the hospital and other services available to married couples. When Yoriko called an ambulance after her partner had a medical emergency at home, she was told to obtain consent from Yamamoto's parents, the couple said. \"Our goal is to use the certificate as a springboard for achieving a society where the rights of sexual minorities are protected,\" Yamamoto said at a news conference sponsored by Partnership Act for Tokyo, a group she leads.Fumino Sugiyama, a transgender activist, said the certificates recognize the presence of sexual minorities and the need to recognize their rights.\"Until now, all the systems, rules and services in Japan have been formed as if LGBTQ people are invisible in this society, and Tokyo's system has been the same,\" Sugiyama said. He called the partnership certificate \"a big step,\" but added, \"This is not the goal, but rather the beginning.\"The Tokyo metropolitan government said it received 137 applications as of last Friday. Applicants are limited to adult residents of the capital, including foreign nationals. Campaigns for equal rights for sexual minorities, including same-sex marriage, have faced resistance from conservatives in Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's governing party who oppose more inclusivity for sexual minorities, calling them \"unproductive.\"Satoko Nagamura and Mamiko Moda, a same-sex couple, are raising their 11-year-old son Ittan, who was given birth by Nagamura by sperm donation.Moda said the certificate only recognizes partnerships between adults and needs to cover children of same-sex couples. \"From a child's perspective, it's like you are abandoned. When the child asks, 'What is this family?' then I also want to have proof as a parent.\"Associated Press videojournalist Haruka Nuga contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A woman who was in bed with her two young children was fatally shot early Tuesday during a home invasion that a Florida sheriff described as \"targeted\" hit.A man knocked on a door in New Port Richey, which is north of Tampa, sometime after 12:30 a.m., Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said during a news conference.The knock awakened a woman who was sleeping on the couch in a front room, the sheriff said.

The man continued on to a bedroom and flipped the light switch, Nocco said.\"The light comes on, she sees the suspect walk into the door,\" he said. \"She sits up. As she sits up she says, 'Don't shoot me.' The suspect then fires one round at her. She falls off the bed. He fires another round directly at her striking her.\"The children, under the age of 12, were not injured in the shooting, he said.The shooter fled the scene and investigators were searching for him.Nocco said he didn't yet know whether the shooting was domestic-related, but anyone involved in a relationship with the woman will be questioned, he said.\"Clearly this person was targeted,\" Nocco said.He said that mental health counselors are working with the two children and the woman.\"For these young kids, I can imagine they were out last night trick-or-treating and I can imagine they went to bed a little later, like all the kids did last night,\" Nocco said. \"But to be woken up, to have a suspect walk in turn that light on and shoot the person who was in the bed with them, that's horrific.

All Rights Reserved.An employee waits for customers at a pharmacy in Jakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Indonesian authorities have revoked the licenses of two pharmaceutical companies producing syrup-type medicines following the deaths of a number of children due to acute kidney injury, officials said Tuesday. (AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana)JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian authorities have revoked the licenses of two pharmaceutical companies to produce syrup-type medicines following the deaths of 159 children due to acute kidney injury, officials said Tuesday.Penny Lukito, chief of the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency, known as BPOM, said it found that PT Yarindo Farmatama and PT Universal Pharmaceutical Industries had changed suppliers of propylene glycol, a component of the syrups, and the type they were using was contaminated with other chemicals.\"If there is a change, it should be reported to BPOM,\" Lukito said. In cases of non-compliance, pharmaceutical companies are \"subject to administrative sanctions in the form of cessation of production, distribution, recall and destruction,\" Lukito said.The agency and the National Police found that the two companies used propylene glycol as a raw material in the production of medicinal syrups. The syrups, often used by children, contained excessive amounts of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol. The findings were based on interviews with employees and an examination of documents, facilities and products of the companies.The two chemicals are often used in industrial applications and in antifreeze and brake fluids. Lukito said BPOM is pursuing criminal charges against the companies.\"Perpetrators face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a maximum fine of 1 billion rupiah (64,000),\" Lukito said.The contamination is suspected of being the cause of a spike in cases of acute kidney disorders in children since the end of August.The Health Ministry reported on Tuesday that there have been 304 cases of acute kidney injury in 27 provinces. Most of the patients were under age 5. The ministry said it has distributed 146 vials of antidotes to 17 hospitals across the country.Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Syahril said the number of new cases and deaths has decreased since the government announced a temporary ban on the use of syrup medicines until the completion of its investigation.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.The fatal shooting of the rapper Takeoff has Houston police asking for the public's help in identifying who shot and killed the 28-year-old member of the Grammy-nominated trio Migos and wounded two other people. (Nov. 1)HOUSTON (AP) -- Police said they have few leads in the fatal shooting of rapper Takeoff outside a private party at a downtown Houston bowling alley.Takeoff, whose off-stage name was Kirsnick Khari Ball, formed one-third of the Grammy Award-nominated trio Migos with uncle Quavo and cousin Offset from suburban Atlanta. The 28-year-old rapper was killed early Tuesday when gunfire erupted and also wounded another man and a woman, according to police Chief Troy Finner.Most of the 40 people who attended the party at 810 Billiards  Bowling fled when the gunshots rang out, Finner said. That left police asking people to come forward and give statements and videos to investigators on what they saw and heard, even if anonymously, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.At least two people discharged firearms, according to Finner. The two others who were struck by gunfire had non-life-threatening wounds and went to hospitals in private vehicles, he said.\"Let me just ask ... that anyone who has information on the shooter or shooters to provide that information to HPD and let us solve this situation,\" Turner said at a news conference Tuesday. \"Let us bring justice to this family.\" Finner said Takeoff was \"well respected,\" and there was \"no reason to believe he was involved in anything criminal at the time.\" Migos' record label, Quality Control, mourned Takeoff's death in a statement posted on Instragram. \"Senseless violence and a stray bullet has taken another life from this world and we are devastated,\" the statement said, though police have said nothing about the gunshot being a stray. \"Please respect his family and friends as we all continue to process this monumental loss.\"The bowling alley is in a three-story Houston retail complex with high-end restaurants and a House of Blues and is near a Four Seasons hotel. Takeoff was pronounced dead at the scene of the 2:30 a.m. shooting. An Associated Press reporter observed a body loaded into a medical examiner's van around 10 a.m., more than seven hours after the shooting.Security guards in the area heard the shooting but did not see who did it, a police spokesperson said. A spokesperson for 810 Billiards  Bowling said the shooting took place after the alley closed and said the business is cooperating with investigators. Several fans gathered across the street from the bowling alley. Isaiah Lopez, 24, said he rushed from his home in the Houston suburb of Humble after hearing Takeoff had been killed.\"He was one of our favorites, mine and my brother's. It's all we would listen to,\" Lopez said as he carried a dozen roses he hoped to place near the site of the shooting. \"As soon as my brother called me and said, 'Takeoff is gone,' I had to come over here and pay my respects.\"Thomas Moreno, 30, lives about five minutes from the bowling alley. He said he met Takeoff at an event at a Houston bar and restaurant in June and called him \"a real nice guy.\"\"I feel it's just another good person gone too soon,\" Moreno said. \"This happens every day, but it hurts even more when it's somebody so talented and so young.\"By late Tuesday afternoon, fans had created a memorial with roses, candles and a teddy bear on the first floor of the retail complex. Yellow crime scene tape still blocked off stairs leading to 810 Billiards  Bowling.Takeoff's killing came as Houston was in a spotlight, with the Astros baseball team mounting the most-viewed World Series run since 2019. Also, crime has emerged as a major political issue in this year's midterm elections, with many Republicans running on law-and-order platforms while Democrats try to balance public safety with calls for criminal-justice reform. Homicides nationwide jumped almost 30 in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime seemed to level off somewhat in 2021 but did not drop to pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest FBI crime data, though record-keeping changes meant that report did not include some of the nation's largest police departments. In Houston, the mayor and police chief acknowledged such concerns while noting that some violent crime rates are down from last year. Finner said he wants to meet with other hip-hop artists to talk about violence, although he didn't say Takeoff's killing had anything to do with is work in music.\"We all need to stand together and make sure nobody tears down that industry,\" Finner said.Migos first broke through with the massive hit \"Versace\" in 2013. They had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, though Takeoff was not on their multi-week No. 1 hit \"Bad and Boujee,\" featuring Lil Uzi Vert. They put out a trilogy of albums called \"Culture,\" \"Culture II\" and \"Culture III,\" with the first two hitting No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. They also earned an ASCAP Vanguard Award in 2018 for their streaming success with multiplatinum songs like \"Motorsport (featuring Cardi B and Nicki Minaj),\" \"Stir Fry,\" and \"Walk It Talk It.\"The trio also played a fictional version of themselves on an episode of the hit TV show \"Atlanta,\" but the group was not currently together.Offset, who is married to Cardi B, released a solo album in 2019, while Takeoff and Quavo released the joint album \"Only Built for Infinity Links\" last month. Quavo posted links Monday on his Instagram to his and Takeoff's Halloween-themed music video, \"Messy,\" along with a video of him and his friends driving around Houston.----This story has been corrected to show that Takeoff was killed Tuesday, not Friday.Landrum reported from Los Angeles.

Campbell faces Republican James McMahon in the November election. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)BOSTON (AP) -- Well before she launched her campaign for the top law enforcement post in Massachusetts, Andrea Campbell carried with her the weight of a life haunted by the specter of crime and the criminal justice system.When she was just a child, Campbell's father was sent to prison for eight years. Her mother died in a car accident on the way to visit him, forcing Campbell and her brothers to live with relatives and in foster care.Much later, her twin brother would die in police custody, and her older brother would face charges in a string of alleged rapes.Despite the trauma and dislocation, the Democratic candidate for attorney general -- who grew up in the Roxbury and South End neighborhoods of Boston, the city's traditional center of Black life -- was able to find a very different path, fueled by success at school, the help of family members and teachers, and her skill at jumping rope.\"One thing I do frequently is share my story because I think there are so many who carry their story with a sense of shame and don't want to talk about it, including the criminal aspects of my family,\" she said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"But there is no shame in one sharing their story. There is power in it.\"Campbell's Republican opponent, Jay McMahon, said a tragedy in his own life -- the death of his son, Joel, from an opioid overdose in 2008 -- was a motivating factor in his decision to run.McMahon said his son served in the Army during the U.S. invasion of Iraq, making it all the way to Baghdad before being injured and prescribed oxycontin, to which he eventually became addicted.Campbell, 40, attended the city's prestigious public exam school, Boston Latin School, which led her to Princeton University, UCLA Law School and a post in the administration of former Gov. Deval Patrick. She became the first Black woman president of the Boston City Council and launched a failed bid for mayor last year.It was through the intervention of family members, employers and teachers that Campbell was able to navigate that path. She recalled one teacher and her husband who bought her clothes so that as she traveled to participate in Double Dutch competitions she could also visit colleges.Campbell said she's learned to turn personal pain into a larger purpose, even after her brother, Alvin Campbell Jr., was arrested for allegedly posing as a ride-hailing driver and kidnapping and raping a woman looking for a ride home after leaving a Boston nightclub. Other similar charges would follow.Campbell said she had her young son in her arms when she learned of the arrest.\"I was holding him, literally getting ready to nurse him, when I got the call about my older brother and his arrest, and it was heart-wrenching,\" Campbell said.\"And then immediately like I've done throughout my life, I had to say, 'OK, now what are you going to do with this?'\" she added. \"Yes I have to deal with my own trauma and pain, which I encourage everyone to do, but it's an opportunity to go deeper ... to make sure we are breaking cycles of violence, of criminalization and so much more.\"She said she hasn't spoken to her brother since his arrest.\"I view my older brother's charges and what is happening there as just another brother lost, which is sad and tragic for me,\" she said. \"So now I have two brothers who are lost.\"Campbell, married with two young boys, said she applauds the courage of any woman who comes forward to share serious allegations of sexual assault, adding: \"We need to probably start from a place of believing them. I've made that crystal clear.\"Although she didn't run to be the state's first Black woman AG, if she wins, the distinction matters, said Campbell, who has vowed to view her job through what she calls an \"equity lens.\"\"On the campaign trail, when people would say what are the top three issues you would address, I would never list racial disparities because living in this gender and this skin, it should be the norm of the office to always be closing racial gaps, to always be taking on sexism or gender or sexual discrimination,\" she said.Campbell, who said her faith is another source of strength, also has pledged to use the office to tackle issues that may have been overlooked by other AGs. Those include prison reform, juvenile justice, health disparities and economics in the state's rural communities.When she got into trouble at school, she said, she was treated differently than her twin brother, Andre. She was typically sent to talk to someone, while Andre often faced a suspension and expulsion hearing.Many who live in communities of color are frustrated with what Campbell describes as a lack of accountability about how crimes are prosecuted, feeling over-policed and over-incarcerated. She said it's too easy to cast those areas as overrun by mobs or gangs.\"I push back on that narrative because I live in one of those communities,\" she said. \"You have folks working two or three jobs, working hard every single day to make sure they are delivering for their families, for their children and for their community.\"On the campaign trail, McMahon has tried to portray Campbell as soft on crime.\"We have a crime wave right now and Andrea Campbell wants to take away qualified immunity and defund the police,\" he said. \"I'll never defund the cops.\"Campbell said what she wants is to make sure no one is above the law, including public employees, elected officials and the police.She also said she hopes her story can serve as inspiration.\"If you look at my life, it is a model and an example of what opportunity can do to move someone out of a very tragic upbringing of trauma, pain, suffering, loss to assist them in reaching their dreams and potential,\" she said.Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

All Rights Reserved.In this photo taken by an individual not employed by the Associated Press and obtained by the AP outside Iran, Iranians protests the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the morality police last month, in Tehran, Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022. (AP Photo/Middle East Images, File)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's currency dropped to its lowest value against the dollar on Tuesday, after weeks of nationwide unrest roiling the country. A stalemate in negotiations to revive Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers has also weighed heavily on the rial. Traders in Tehran exchanged the rial at 338,000 to the dollar, up from 332,200 on Monday. Iran's currency was trading at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of the 2015 nuclear accord that lifted international sanctions in exchange for tight curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. The rial's new low comes amid protests first sparked by the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police. She was detained for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. The demonstrations have swept the country, morphing into one of the boldest challenges to Iran's ruling clerics since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Security forces have sought to quash dissent, killing at least 270 people and arresting some 14,000, according to rights groups.Protesters have targeted Iran's state-mandated headscarf, or hijab, for women. But the sickly state of Iran's economy is also a main force driving Iranians into the streets. Soaring prices, high unemployment and corruption have fueled the unrest.The Iran nuclear deal has been teetering toward collapse since talks stalled months ago. After protests erupted, the United States and European Union imposed additional sanctions on Iran for its brutal treatment of demonstrators and its decision to send hundreds of drones to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine. The White House has faced growing pressure to scuttle the deal altogether. The U.S. special envoy to Iran, Robert Malley, said on Monday that the administration \"makes no apology\" for its refusal to declare the deal dead.Iran's economy has deteriorated significantly since former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear deal in 2018 and restored suffocating sanctions on Iran's crucial oil and banking sectors.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - The logo for Uber appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Aug. 9, 2019. Shares of Uber are surging before the market open Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, after the ride-hailing company gave a fourth-quarter forecast indicating that consumers are growing increasingly more comfortable using the service now that pandemic fears have mostly eased. Uber Technologies Inc. announced that it foresees fourth-quarter gross bookings rising 23 to 27 year over year on a constant-currency basis, totaling 30 billion to 31 billion. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)Shares of Uber surged Tuesday after the company said there is little evidence that Americans are pulling back on hailing rides or ordering food deliveries despite soaring inflation. \"Cities are reopening, travel is building, and more broadly a continued shift of consumer spending from retail back to services,\" said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. \"We've seen these trends continue into the fourth quarter with October tracking to be our best month ever for mobility and total company gross bookings.\"The company expects fourth-quarter gross bookings to rise 23 to 27 from last year, totaling 30 billion to 31 billion. Shares of Uber Technologies Inc., down almost 30 this year, jumped 15 at the opening bell to 30.57. In the most recent quarter, gross bookings increased 26 to 29.1 billion, or 32 on a constant-currency basis. Trips grew 19 to about 21 million trips a day, on average.The San Francisco ride-hailing service struggled during the pandemic amid lockdowns, but has thrived with the rollout of vaccinations as Americans head back to the office, go out on the town, or stay home and order dinner from a restaurant. Uber had struggled to find enough drivers to meet demand and last month, the Biden administration proposed new standards that would make it more difficult to classify millions of workers as independent contractors. That could effect companies like Uber and company shares on the day the proposal was released tumbled by double digits. Khosrowshahi said Tuesday that any ruling along those lines \"effectively returns us to the framework during Obama's presidency which was a framework in which we grew significantly.\"He said there is an ongoing dialog with states about how workers are classified and providing protections for independent contractors. \"The road is going to be bumpy and for us the nature of work is always going to be a big issue that we have a responsibility to shape going forward in dialogue obviously with local governments,\" Khosrowshahi said. Industry analysts see tailwinds ahead for Uber as life returns to normal after the pandemic. \"Uber is continuing to see healthy growth as the driver shortage is essentially over while the company continues to benefit from travel returning, shifting to the office, and other post-pandemic trends continue to hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,\" Wedbush's Dan Ives wrote Tuesday. Third-quarter revenue rose to 8.34 billion from 4.85 billion. This beat the expectations of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, who predicted 8.08 billion in revenue.Uber lost 1.21 billion, or 61 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30. That compares with a wider loss of 2.42 billion, or 1.28 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street was looking for a loss of 17 cents per share. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

But Palou's sponsor is headed to McLaren early; Palou can't drive an Indy car for McLaren before he makes his official move in 2024.\"We welcome the opportunity to partner with McLaren, a long-term and valued client, and to demonstrate how sponsorships simultaneously build awareness and enhance business-to-business relationships,\" said Bob Pryor, CEO of NTT Data Services.Brown and Ganassi have feuded for years but it reached a new height when Palou in July rebuked a Ganassi announcement that the option on his contract for 2023 had been picked up. He said he instead was moving to McLaren, which led to several civil court filings and the ultimate resolution for Palou to complete his Ganassi contract.Also, McLaren team president Taylor Keil has left the organization and is expected to be announced as a Ganassi executive as soon as his non-compete clause expires. Keil is the stepson of longtime Ganassi managing director Mike Hull.Kanaan, who spent four of the final six years of full-time IndyCar competition with Ganassi, is slowly moving toward retirement. His third-place finish at Indy in May made the Brazilian eager to return again in 2023 at age 48.\"I feel extremely lucky to get another shot racing in the Indy 500,\" said Kanaan, who will be part of McLaren's first four-car Indy 500 lineup alongside Rosenqvist, Pato O'Ward and 2015 winner Alexander Rossi.\"I'm excited to work with Pato, Felix and Alexander and race with the Arrow McLaren SP team. My biggest battle in last year's race was against these three drivers so working with them and driving with them will be exciting for all of us,\" Kanaan said.Rosenqvist started his IndyCar career with Ganassi and drove the No. 10 sponsored by NTT Data for two seasons. Rosenqvist moved to McLaren ahead of the 2021 season, the first year of NTT Data's last Ganassi contact extension, and Palou replaced Rosenqvist as the driver in the No. 10.\"I look forward to representing NTT DATA once again,\" Rosenqvist said. \"They're a great partner and are committed to the series.\"AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The family of Egypt's most prominent imprisoned activist says he began a \"full hunger strike\" on Tuesday and plans to stop drinking water as of Sunday, the first day of the global climate summit, or COP27, that Egypt is hosting this month. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)LONDON (AP) -- Egypt's most prominent imprisoned activist went on a \"full hunger strike\"' on Tuesday and plans to stop drinking water on the first day of the global climate summit next week, his family said. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, an outspoken dissident and a U.K. citizen, rose to prominence with the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings that swept the Middle East and in Egypt toppled long-time President Hosni Mubarak. The 40-year old activist spent most of the past decade behind bars and his detention has become a symbol of Egypt's return to autocratic rule.As international spotlight focuses on Egypt ahead of the climate summit -- or COP27 -- in the Red Sea town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Abdel-Fattah's family has been lobbying for his release. His sister, Sanaa Seif, has been staging a sit-in at the headquarters of Britain's Foreign Ministry to push the U.K. to take action in his case.Abdel-Fattah said in a letter to his family that he would start the \"full hunger strike,\" Seif said Tuesday.For more than six months, Abdel-Fattah has been on a partial hunger strike, consuming only 100 calories a day and his family is concerned for his health. He wrote that on Nov. 6, the first day of the COP27, he will also give up water. The family, which communicates with Abdel-Fattah through weekly letters and during rare visits, says it fears that if Abdel-Fattah is not released during the climate conference, he would die without water. The family's next visit is Nov. 17. An Egyptian government media officer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Authorities have previously denied that Abdel-Fattah is on a hunger strike.He was first sentenced in 2014 after being convicted of taking part in an unauthorized protest and allegedly assaulting a police officer. He was released in 2019 after serving a five-year term but was rearrested later that year in a crackdown that followed rare anti-government protests.In December 2021, he was sentenced to another five-year term on charges of spreading false news. He also faces separate charges of misusing social media and joining a terrorist group -- a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which authorities declared a terrorist organization in 2013. In April, the family announced he had obtained British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, a math professor at Cairo University who was born in London. The family said then that they sought a British passport for Abdel-Fattah as a way out of his \"impossible ordeal.\"The family has criticized U.K. leaders for failing to push for a consular visit to Abdel-Fattah in the detention facility, especially as he is one of the tens of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt. Human Rights Watch estimates there are more than 60,000 behind bars. \"Alaa is a British citizen. He can be saved. There is a way out for him that is politically easy and face-saving for the Egyptian regime, only if the British government presses enough for his release,\" Seif told The Associated Press, as she stood outside the U.K.'s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office headquarters. The government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, a U.S. ally with deep economic ties to European countries, has been relentlessly silencing dissenters and clamping down on independent organizations for years with arrests and restrictions. Many of the top activists involved in the 2011 uprising have fled the country or are now in prison, most under a draconian law passed in 2013 that effectively banned all street protests. In several instances, activists who carry dual citizenship have been deported and been made to give up their Egyptian citizenship. Ahead of the global climate conference, Egypt's human rights record has come under increasing scrutiny, though many activists fear that the attention to Abdel-Fattah's case will wane as soon as the conference draws to a close and world leaders return home. \"Alaa is in danger, he decided that if they're determined to keep him in prison forever, or until he dies, then at least he will decide the terms of the last battle and lead the charge,\" his other sister, Mona Seif said in a video statement posted on social media. \"I can't ask him to stop what he's doing,\"An influential blogger, Abdel-Fattah hails from a family of political activists, lawyers and writers. His late father was one of Egypt's most tireless rights lawyers. His sisters -- also British citizens -- are also political activists, and his aunt is the award-winning novelist Ahdaf Soueif.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

They will decompose over winter to provide nourishment for the trees and future plantings. (Jessica Damiano via AP)If you're planning a new bed for perennials, groundcovers, shrubs or trees to plant next spring, the path to success starts with a good foundation. It's easier to improve soil before plants are in place, so the time to do so is now.Before beginning, remove weeds from the area.Next, test your soil's pH. Test kits are reasonably priced and widely available. Plus, most states have university-affiliated agricultural extension offices that offer low-cost testing services to home gardeners.Each plant species thrives best at a specific pH range. If the reading is outside the target range for a plant, it won't be able to avail itself of nutrients, whether from soil or fertilizer. So consider what you'll be planting next year, learn its pH requirement and amend the soil if necessary.Agriculture limestone will raise pH, and aluminum sulfate or sulfur will lower it. The package label will provide directions for your soil type and the bed's square footage.If you're fortunate enough to have autumn leaves littering your property, push a thin layer of them into beds and borders. If possible, shred them first with a mulching mower.Then layer 3-4 inches of well-sourced, unsterilized compost over the leaves (or directly on the soil in the absence of leaves) and level it out with a stiff-tined rake. It will feed beneficial microbes and other soil-dwelling organisms, and release high-quality nutrients into the ground to feed your plants.Contrary to long-held gardening beliefs, it's best not to till amendments into the soil. Doing so could damage soil structure, break up valuable fungal threads, kill earthworms and other beneficial insects, and bring weed seeds to the surface.Remember, the richest soil is found on the forest floor, and nobody's been digging that up. So, unless your aim is to correct a drainage issue, emulate nature and place amendments directly on the earth. They'll work their way down over the next few months.Apply 2-3 inches of mulch over the compost to further suppress weeds and moderate soil temperature and moisture over the winter. If plants are already growing in the bed, postpone adding mulch until after a hard frost, and keep both compost and mulch a few inches from stems and trunks to prevent rot.By spring, the benefits of the amendments will be available at root level, and the soil will have softened for easier planting. Push the mulch away and install your plants.Your new garden will thrive in the rich, organic environment you've created, and reward you with vigorous growth, beautiful flowers and productive vegetables. And they'll be sturdier, healthier and better able to withstand pests and diseases.---Jessica Damiano writes regular gardening columns for The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Pakistan said Tuesday that most victims of the unprecedented floods that struck the country last summer have now returned to their homes, with only a small portion still living in makeshift camps in the worst-hit, southern Sindh province. The country's disaster management agency said the latest data shows that slightly less than 50,000 people are currently staying in camps in Sindh, compared to half a million who were living in tents there in September. The record-breaking floods -- which were worsened by climate change, that hit Pakistan last summer -- killed 1,735 people and displaced 33 million. In Sindh alone, the floods affected 12 million people and killed 796. Pakistan has asked the international community to scale up aid for flood survivors, now threatened by the upcoming winter. Last month, the World Bank estimated that the floods caused 40 billion in damages. Harsh winter weather could worsen the misery of flood victims -- if food and other supplies were not delivered quickly.Cash-strapped Pakistan was already facing a serious financial crisis before the abnormally heavy monsoon rains hit in mid-June, triggering the floods that at one point left a third of the country's territory submerged.The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report Tuesday that there is still standing water in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. And though the floods badly affected the country's crops, Tuesday's report said 98 of the area for wheat cultivation remains available for the next planting season -- a positive sign as Pakistan has already started importing wheat to avoid any food shortage.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

They will perform a chant or song specific to each country, chosen by the organizers, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.\"We will share with you the chant/song selected from your country to ensure you are familiar with it,\" organizers told the fans.The program has excluded \"persons with obvious political affiliation\" and aims to recruit 30 to 50 supporters from each team who were able to show \"their status as a purist fan,\" the documents state.\"The camera will focus on each national fan group in turn,\" the recruits have been told about the show at Al Bayt Stadium north of Doha. \"Be ready in your shirt, flags and scarves to cheer and shout.\"The fans are being offered economy-class flights and use of apartments worth thousands of dollars to stay until at least Dec. 4, or for the entire tournament if they choose, plus a daily allowance of 250 Qatari riyals (68).The opening ceremony project is an extension of a longer-term plan by World Cup organizers to choose \"Fan Leaders\" in each country who are asked to be social media influencers using the hashtag \"IAMAFAN.\"Those key fans are asked to \"incorporate, where appropriate\" content provided by Qatari organizers and support the World Cup \"by 'liking' and re-sharing third party posts.\"The fan leaders have been told \"we are not asking you to (be) a mouthpiece for Qatar,\" but \"it would obviously not be appropriate for you to disparage\" the country or the tournament.The influencers have also had to agree to \"report any offensive, degrading or abusive comments\" on social media to the organizing committee and, if possible, take screenshots.In a statement, Qatari organizers said they had consulted with a \"Fan Leader Network\" of more than 450 people in 59 countries to help improve the World Cup for visitors.\"As the tournament nears, we have invited our most active fan leaders to personally nominate a small selection of fans to join us as our guests to participate in the opening ceremony,\" the Qatari Supreme Committee for Delivery  Legacy said, as a way of \"thanking them for their collaboration.\"The Qataris claim that the influencers are \"leaders within their communities.\" But the Football Supporters Europe group, which is recognized by UEFA to consult on fan issues, disputed that assertion.\"What is very clear is that they are not fan representatives. They are employees or volunteers of the World Cup and should be considered as such,\" FSE executive director Ronan Evain told the AP.About 1.2 million international visitors are expected in Qatar for the month-long tournament, which has faced criticism and skepticism ever since the gas-rich emirate was picked by FIFA in December 2010.Qatar was among nine candidates to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup. The process later underwent a FIFA-appointed investigation into the integrity of bidding campaigns.The FIFA ethics committee, which had limited powers to gather evidence, said in a 2014 report published in full three years later that there was widespread misconduct among the bidders but it had not swayed the hosting votes. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup and Qatar got the 2022 edition.Qatar has since faced intense scrutiny and criticism of its treatment of migrant workers, who were needed to build essential World Cup projects including stadiums, metro lines, roads, hotels and apartments, often in oppressive heat.Although Qatar bid to stage a June-July tournament with air-conditioned stadiums, FIFA decided in 2015 to move the World Cup into cooler months in the middle of the traditional European soccer season.Fans who wished to be picked for the trips to perform in the opening ceremony had to send a statement or image showing their love of soccer by an Oct. 10 deadline. They are being given tickets only to the opening match, during what was described to them as a \"curated visit to Qatar\" with no obligation to take part in other events such as a soccer tournament for fans.\"It is an unpaid and voluntary role,\" the Qatari organizing committee said.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday stopped short of conceding the election to leftist rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, instead using his first public comments since his defeat two days ago to thank his supporters and encourage their protests, as long as they remain peaceful.Moments after the remarks, which lasted less than two minutes, the outgoing president's chief of staff, Ciro Nogueira, announced that Bolsonaro had authorized him to begin the process of handing over power. The conservative leader, who before the election had repeatedly questioned the reliability of the country's electoral system, had little room for potentially rejecting the results. U.S. President Joe Biden and other international leaders have publicly recognized da Silva's victory, as have some of Bolsonaro's closest allies. And Cabinet members, governors-elect and evangelical leaders who have been strident supporters of Bolsonaro are now offering overtures to the incoming leftist government.Bolsonaro lost Sunday's race by a thin margin, garnering 49.1 of the vote to da Silva's 50.9, according to the nation's electoral authority. It was the tightest presidential race since Brazil's return to democracy in 1985, and marks the first time Bolsonaro has lost an election in his 34-year political career.Flanked by more than a dozen ministers and allies as he delivered his short speech at the presidential residence, the fiery leader did not mention the election results, however. Instead, he defended his tenure. \"I have always been labeled as anti-democratic and, unlike my accusers, I have always played within the four lines of the constitution,\" he said. Bolsonaro also thanked the 58 million people who voted for him and said he supports ongoing protests by truckers who have erected nationwide roadblocks, as long as they don't become violent. \"Current popular movements are the result of indignation and a feeling of injustice regarding how the electoral process occurred,\" he said. The president's statement amounted to a \"two-fold move,\" said Thomas Traumann, an independent political analyst. \"He didn't recognize his defeat, and sustains the suspense,\" Traumann said. \"But as he wants to continue to dominate, to be the leader, he maintains the possibility of peaceful demonstrations.\" Much like former U.S. President Donald Trump, whom Bolsonaro openly admires, the far-right incumbent has claimed that electronic voting machines are prone to fraud. He never provided any proof, even when ordered to do so by the electoral court.Many of his supporters also said they believed the election had been fraudulent and some called for military intervention and for Congress and the Supreme Court to be disbanded. Earlier Tuesday, the Brazilian Supreme Court ordered the federal highway police to immediately clear the roadblocks.A majority of the court's justices backed the decision, which accuses the highway police of \"omission and inertia.\" Failure to comply will mean its director could be fined up to 100,000 reais (more than 19,000) per hour, be removed from his duties and even face arrest. Federal prosecutors in Sao Paulo and Goias states said they had opened investigations into the blockades. Highway police said late Tuesday that they had removed 358 blockades, but more than 200 were still in place.Earlier in Sao Paulo -- Brazil's most populous state and largest economy -- traffic jams around the international airport led to dozens of flight cancellations, with videos on social media showing travelers rolling their suitcases along the highway in the dark trying to catch their flights. The highways had been cleared by Tuesday morning, but airport officials said access remained difficult as traffic was still backed up in and out of the airport.There, Dalmir Almeida, a 38-year-old protester, told The Associated Press that after completing three days of strikes, he and others will drive their trucks to the military barracks to ask for their support. \"The army will be in our favor,\" he added.At another road block in Sao Paulo state, protesters set tires on fire. Several demonstrators were wrapped in the Brazilian flag, which has been co-opted by the nation's conservative movement for demonstrations. Huge lines of cars could be seen snaking along the highway.Concern about escalation grew as the country's leftist Landless Workers' Movement, a key ally of da Silva's that has long staged occupations of what it considers vacant or unused lands, asked its militants on Tuesday to organize demonstrations in several states to unblock roads.Sao Paulo Gov. Rodrigo Garcia told a news conference that the time for negotiations was over, and he was not ruling out the use of force by law enforcement.In Minas Gerais, a key battleground state in the election, a video on social media showed a protester telling a reporter from the O Tempo news outlet that the election was \"fraudulent\" and warned of future protests. \"We want Bolsonaro in 2023 and for the years to come,\" he said. In Itaborai, a region in Rio de Janeiro state, an Associated Press reporter saw truck drivers kneeling in front of police officers and refusing to evacuate.Users on social media, including in multiple Telegram and WhatsApp chat groups with names like \"Paralysation,\" shared demands that the military take the streets, or that Congress and the Supreme Court be disbanded and the president remain in office.Following the election, the electoral authority blocked two dozen Telegram groups that defended a military coup and called on their more than 150,000 followers to organize demonstrations, according to online news site UOL.The Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday permits regular state police forces to reinforce federal highway police. The same was done in 2018, when an 11-day trucker strike brought Brazil to a halt.Bolsonaro commands wide support from the police forces' rank and file, however, and it wasn't clear how effective their involvement would be.The 2018 stoppage caused food prices to spike and left supermarket shelves without products as gas stations ran out of fuel. It caused billions in losses and revealed the vast power that truckers possess, particularly when they organize through social media platforms.Bolsonaro, a lawmaker at the time and months away from winning that year's presidential election, was an outspoken supporter of the truckers, who are now among his constituents. This year, his administration limited interstate fuel taxes to help bring down prices and launched a financial aid program for truckers just months before the election. In his speech Tuesday, Bolsonaro was \"sending a message to his hardcore supporters to keep protesting,\" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of Igarape Institute, a Rio de Janeiro-based think tank focused on security. \"He's playing with fire: There's a real risk that prolonged unrest and police inaction could ignite simmering tensions.\"Jeantet reported from Rio de Janeiro.

An attacker threw firebombs an immigration center in the English port town of Dover on Sunday before killing himself, officials said. One other person was lightly injured. The Kent Police force said \"two to three incendiary devices\" were thrown at the facility where recently arrived migrants are taken, and \"one minor injury has been reported.\" (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)LONDON (AP) -- Britain's interior minister faced criticism Tuesday for describing migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats as an \"invasion,\" days after an immigration center was attacked with firebombs.Home Secretary Suella Braverman used the term while defending conditions at a processing center for new arrivals where some 4,000 people have been held in a facility intended for 1,600.Braverman referred to small-boat crossings on Monday as \"the invasion of our southern coast\" and said \"illegal immigration is out of control.\"\"Let's stop pretending that they are all refugees in distress,\" she said of migrants crossing the Channel.Her deputy, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, distanced himself from her words.\"In a job like mine you have to choose your words very carefully,\" he told Sky News. \"And I would never demonize people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life.\"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who appointed Braverman after he took office last week, told his Cabinet on Tuesday that Britain \"would always be a compassionate, welcoming country,\" his spokesman said.Braverman -- a leading figure on the right wing of the governing Conservative Party who supports expelling people who enter the U.K. without authorization -- did not respond to the criticism on Tuesday.The number of asylum-seekers attempting to reach Britain by boat has increased steadily, and the system for considering applications has slowed to a crawl amid turmoil in the Conservative government, which is on its third prime minister and third home secretary this year.Manston -- a former airfield in southeast England -- is supposed to be a temporary processing center where new arrivals spend 24 hours before moving on to longer-term accommodation, but refugee groups say some people have been stuck there for weeks. Some families are sleeping in tents, and there have been cases of diphtheria and scabies.Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor said that when he visited the site recently, he saw people sleeping on floors and \"lots and lots of people in a room, all squished in together.\"\"For a few hours, that would be acceptable, but where people are spending long periods of time there, it just isn't,\" he told Sky News.Critics accuse Braverman of deliberately worsening conditions at Manston by refusing to book hotel rooms for asylum seekers.The government said \"large numbers\" of people were being moved out of Manston on Tuesday to relieve pressure. It said a facility some 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the port town of Dover that was firebombed Sunday had reopened.Police said counterterrorism officers were leading the investigation into the firebombing, which slightly injured two staff members. The suspect, a 66-year-old man from a town about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away, threw \"a number of crude incendiary devices,\" then drove away and killed himself.Detective Chief Superintendent Olly Wright of Counter Terrorism Policing South East said the attack was \"likely to be driven by some form of hate-filled grievance.\"Just over 48,000 people applied for asylum in the U.K. in 2021, fewer than in Germany, France or Spain. But there has been a sharp increase in the number of people trying to cross the Channel in dinghies and other small craft as alternative routes, such as stowing away on trucks, have become more difficult.Some 40,000 people have made the hazardous journey across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes so far this year, up from 28,000 in all of 2021 and 8,500 in 2020. Dozens have died, including 27 people in November 2021 when a packed smuggling boat capsized.Britain and France have wrangled over how to stop the people-smuggling gangs that organize the journeys.Britain's government has announced a controversial plan to send people who arrive in small boats on a one-way journey to Rwanda -- a plan it says will deter people from crossing the Channel and break the business model of smuggling gangs. Critics say the plan is immoral and impractical, and it is being challenged in the courts.Mishka Pillay, campaigns consultant with the group Detention Action, said the Manston crisis arose because \"the government has failed to process asylum claims efficiently,\" creating a huge backlog.\"This is a crisis of the home secretary's own making,\" Pillay said.Follow all AP stories on global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File)DUBLIN (AP) -- Cheslin Kolbe will return from a three-month absence because of a broken jaw to start a test at fullback for South Africa for the first time against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday.Kolbe's move to 15 allows Makazole Mapimpi and Kurt-Lee Arendse to start on the wings in a highly anticipated meeting between the world champion Springboks and the No. 1-ranked Irish.Damian Willemse was kept at flyhalf in the South Africa team named on Tuesday after he finished the Rugby Championship there following an injury to Handre Pollard.Lukhanyo Am is still missing for South Africa and Jesse Kriel will stand in again at outside center at Lansdowne Road. The pack is as expected, with Steven Kitshoff, Malcolm Marx and Frans Malherbe in the front row, Eben Etzebeth and Lood de Jager in the second row, and Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit and Jasper Wiese the loose forwards.Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber also gambled again on a forward-heavy 6-2 split on the bench -- a regular South Africa tactic -- with utility Willie le Roux and scrumhalf Faf de Klerk the two backline players and no specialist cover at flyhalf.Kolbe broke his jaw in the home series against Wales in July but Nienaber said he came through four games with club side Toulon to prove his readiness for South Africa's European tour opener.Ireland is flying high after an historic series victory in New Zealand in July and has won the last two meetings against the Boks in Dublin, including a 38-3 drubbing the last time they met in 2017.South Africa and Ireland are also in the same group at next year's Rugby World Cup in France.\"Obviously we are a long way out from the World Cup,\" Nienaber said, \"but we have a limited number of matches left before the competition and the preparation doesn't get better than playing a side we will face in the World Cup and the No. 1 side in the world.\"The Springboks go from Dublin to Marseille to play No. 2-ranked France and also face Italy and England on their four-game trip.South Africa: Cheslin Kolbe, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Makazole Mapimpi, Damian Willemse, Jaden Hendrikse; Jasper Wiese, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Siya Kolisi (captain), Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Malcolm Marx, Steven Kitshoff.

All Rights Reserved.ROME (AP) -- A court in Sicily on Tuesday convicted 91 defendants of roles in a organized crime scheme that bilked the European Union of some 5 million euros (dollars) in subsidies for grazing land on the Mediterranean island. The reading of the verdicts and sentences took so long, the court in Patti began announcing its decision late Monday night and finished early the next day. The sentences ranged from two years to 30. Ten defendants were acquitted. The trial began in March 2021 and deliberations lasted a week.Prosecutors alleged that dozens of reputed Mafia members and white-collar professionals had colluded to defraud the EU of subsidies for use of grazing land, including Nebrodi state parkland in the eastern end of Sicily. In its account of the trial, Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica said 150 companies fraudulently obtained some 5 million euros from 2010 to 2017, including for land that only existed on paper.Former park director Giuseppe Antoci, who helped investigators to uncover the scheme, was in the courtroom to hear the verdicts. He narrowly escaped death in 2016 when bullets raked his car. Investigators suspected the attack was the work of local members of Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia.Antoci told reporters that hearing the verdicts was an emotional moment after \"years of sacrifice for myself and my family.\" Among the charges that resulted in convictions were extortion and fraud against the European Union. Prosecutors contended that in some instances, defendants used violence and threats to gain control of existing pastures so they could apply for the subsidies. Prosecutors said the elaborate fraud scheme involved the extensive use of figurehead owners to obtain the EU funds. The allocated funds then moved through a complex system of financial instruments, including accounts abroad, before winding up with the fraudsters, prosecutors alleged. To obtain the funds, applicants had to certify they had no links to organized crime, and the attestations provided were often false, investigators said. In arguing for indictment, prosecutors alleged that complicit notaries and bureaucrats handling the paperwork helped Cosa Nostra clan bosses carry out the scheme. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Giusti, File)SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. secretary of energy was scheduled to visit Puerto Rico Tuesday for the second time in less than two weeks as the island struggles with a crumbling power grid and constant power outages worsened by recent hurricanes. During her last visit, Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned of numerous \"critical failures\" and the federal government pledged to help speed up reconstruction of the U.S. territory's power grid, which was devastated by 2017's Hurricane Maria.The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has set aside nearly 10 billion to rebuild the grid, but only 183 million in projects have been approved.Reconstruction of the grid had just started when Hurricane Fiona, a Category 1 storm swiped Puerto Rico's southwest corner in September, causing an islandwide blackout.\"Fiona also underscored that five years after Maria, almost none of the federal money allocated for permanent work on the electrical grid has actually been spent,\" said Tom Sanzillo, director of financial analysis at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in Ohio.He noted that citizens, communities and businesses have invested in solar power on their own, with more than 43,000 rooftop solar systems installed since Maria, representing at least 10 times the amount of FEMA funds spent on the grid.Granholm is expected to meet behind closed doors with stakeholders and government groups to find solutions. Some Puerto Ricans have demanded the ouster of Luma, a private company that took over the island's transmission and distribution of power last year.On Tuesday, Sunrun -- the largest rooftop solar installer in the U.S. -- announced a deal with Puerto Rico's Electric Power Company to launch the island's first \"virtual\" power plant to help reduce power bills and offer a backup energy source.Chris Rauscher, Sunrun's senior director of policy, said in a phone interview Monday that some 7,000 homes with solar batteries would supply additional energy to the power grid, effectively creating a plant. Each home would be capable of providing enough energy for its own needs as well as those of up to three other households, he said.\"People here in Puerto Rico are sick and tired of the power they're getting from the utility grid and how unreliable it is,\" he said. The amount and details of the contract have not yet been made public because it is awaiting regulatory approval from Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau and a federal control board that oversees the island's finances.Power plants on the island use fossil fuel to generate 97 of its electricity. The government has pledged to obtain 40 of its power from renewable resources by 2025 and 60 by 2040.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira)MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips should recover from their injuries in time to be available to England for the World Cup, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said on Tuesday.England coach Gareth Southgate will announce his squad next week and is unlikely to see Walker or Phillips return to action before naming his 26-man group for the tournament that starts on Nov. 20.\"It's likely, the way they recover,\" Guardiola said, when asked about the two players' chances of being fit for the World Cup. \"I don't know the intention for Gareth, but it's likely.\"He spoke with the players regularly, with the doctors, and they know exactly better than me. But what I hear in the dressing room, it's likely they can be ready.\"Walker underwent a groin operation last month, while Phillips had surgery on his shoulder in September. Both played a key role in England's run to the European Championship final last year.Guardiola said Phillips was ahead of Walker in his recovery but was still doing only \"partial\" and \"non-contact\" training sessions.\"I know how important the World Cup is,\" Guardiola said. \"But I'm not going to use a player I feel is not ready for the physicality, the rhythm.\"What's certain is that neither Walker nor Phillips will play against Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday in a game that has little riding on it for either team. City is sure of topping the group and Sevilla will finish third.Erling Haaland will also miss the game at Etihad Stadium, Guardiola said, after being ruled out of the 1-0 win at Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday because of ligament damage in his foot.Guardiola said City's star striker is improving but \"still not 100\" and is not training with the team.\"We don't want to take a risk, there's no sense,\" Guardiola said. \"Hopefully we can have him against Fulham (on Saturday).\"AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mohamed Sheikh Nor)LONDON (AP) -- Ships loaded with grain departed Ukraine on Tuesday despite Russia suspending its participation in a U.N.-brokered deal that ensures safe wartime passage of critical food supplies meant for parts of the world struggling with hunger. But the United Nations said vessels would not move Wednesday, raising concerns about future shipments.Three ships carrying 84,490 metric tons of corn, wheat and sunflower meal left Ukraine through a humanitarian sea corridor set up in July, while 36 other vessels cleared inspections near Turkey to head to their final destinations, the U.N. said. The corridor, brokered by Turkey and U.N., was seen as a breakthrough to ensure Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia would receive grain and other food from the Black Sea region during Russia's war in Ukraine.Russia cited allegations of a Ukrainian drone attack against its Black Sea fleet in announcing over the weekend that it was suspending its part in the grain deal. The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that ship traffic from ports in southern Ukraine was halted, calling the movement \"unacceptable.\"But a total of 14 ships sailed that day, including one chartered by the U.N. World Food Program to bring wheat to Ethiopia, which along with neighboring Somalia and Kenya, is badly affected by the worst drought in decades. The U.N. has warned that parts of Somalia are facing famine. Thousands of people have died there.Despite grain-laden ships leaving Ukraine this week, the U.N. announced that such vessels would not travel Wednesday, raising fears about the future of the initiative. Amir Abdulla, the agreement's U.N. coordinator, later tweeted that \"we expect loaded ships to sail on Thursday.\"But it was unclear what would happen later this week. Ukraine, Turkey and the U.N. have carried out vessel inspections without Russia, allowing some shipments to continue, in what the international body called \"a temporary and extraordinary measure.\"The U.N. operation had been prioritizing a large backlog of ships waiting for checks off Istanbul, said Munro Anderson, head of intelligence of the risk consultancy Dryad Global. After suspending its participation, \"it is likely that Russia will use this as a tool of negotiation to secure what it needs from the deal,\" Anderson said. \"We know that Russia has been looking to export fertilizer products and to seek a sanctions reprieve on those so it can do so effectively.\" While Western sanctions on Russia don't affect its grain exports and a parallel wartime deal was meant to clear the way for the country's food and fertilizer shipments, some shipping and insurance companies have been wary of running afoul of the penalties or want to avoid doing business with Moscow.Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed to the fertilizer issue in a call Tuesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying Russia's agricultural exports still were not unblocked. Putin also said resuming the grain deal would require an investigation into the attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet, according to a Kremlin readout of the call.Erdogan told Putin \"that if they solve the grain crisis through a constructive approach, they will (also) encourage steps toward a return to negotiations\" to end the war in Ukraine, according to the Turkish president's office.The July 22 deal to spur exports of grain and fertilizer was a response to skyrocketing food prices as a result of slashed supplies from two major producers following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The U.N. said that as of Tuesday, more than 9.7 million metric tons of grain and other food has been shipped from three Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea.Analysts say Russia still is bound by the terms of the grain deal it signed, which include a commitment not to target civilian vessels taking part in the initiative. Such an attack also would violate international law.\"Although it is not currently participating in that deal, it is still a signatory to it. Russia's interests are not going to be served in any way, shape or form by attacking vessels and groups in the international community,\" Anderson said.He added that Russia's primary concern is likely that vessels might be going unchecked and could be used to bring in weapons. That is why the grain deal established a Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul to coordinate checks between the warring nations, Turkey and the U.N.Russia has announced plans to conduct its own inspections of ships that have already cleared the joint checks in Istanbul, but further details were not known.

Scott Applewhite)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday put a temporary hold on the handover of former President Donald Trump's tax returns to a congressional committee.Roberts' order gives the Supreme Court time to weigh the legal issues in Trump's emergency appeal to the high court, filed Monday.Without court intervention, the tax returns could have been provided as early as Thursday by the Treasury Department to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee.Roberts gave the committee until Nov. 10 to respond. The chief justice handles emergency appeals from the nation's capital, where the fight over Trump's taxes has been going on since 2019.Lower courts ruled that the committee has broad authority to obtain tax returns and rejected Trump's claims that it was overstepping.If Trump can persuade the nation's highest court to intervene in this case, he could potentially delay a final decision until the start of the next Congress in January. If Republicans recapture control of the House in the fall election, they could drop the records request.The temporary delay imposed by Roberts is the third such order issued by justices in recent days in cases related to Trump.The court separately is weighing Sen. Lindsey Graham's emergency appeal to avoid having to testify before a Georgia grand jury that is investigating potential illegal interference by Trump and his allies in the 2020 election in the state.Also before the court is an emergency appeal from Arizona Republican party chairwoman Kelli Ward to prevent the handover of phone records to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The House Ways and Means panel and its chairman, Democrat Richard Neal of Massachusetts, first requested Trump's tax returns in 2019 as part of an investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's audit program and tax law compliance by the former president. A federal law says the Internal Revenue Service \"shall furnish\" the returns of any taxpayer to a handful of top lawmakers.The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, had defended a decision by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to withhold the tax returns from Congress. Mnuchin argued that he could withhold the documents because he concluded they were being sought by Democrats for partisan reasons. A lawsuit ensued.After President Joe Biden took office, the committee renewed the request, seeking Trump's tax returns and additional information from 2015-2020. The White House took the position that the request was a valid one and that the Treasury Department had no choice but to comply. Trump then attempted to halt the handover in court.Then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. obtained copies of Trump's personal and business tax records as part of a criminal investigation. That case, too, went to the Supreme Court, which rejected Trump's argument that he had broad immunity as president.Trump had most recently sought the justices' intervention in a legal dispute stemming from the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in August. The court rejected that appeal.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September 2022, suggesting that the American labor market is not cooling as fast as the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve hoped.

Huh, File)WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting that the American labor market is not cooling as fast as the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve hoped.Employers posted 10.7 million job vacancies in September, up from 10.3 million in August, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Economists had expected the number of job openings to drop below 10 million for the first time since June 2021.For the past two years, as the economy rebounded from 2020's COVID-19 recession, employers have complained they can't find enough workers. With so many jobs available, workers can afford to resign and seek employment that pays more or offers better perks or flexibility. So companies have been forced to raise wages to attract and keep staff. Higher pay has contributed to inflation that has hit 40-year highs in 2022.In another sign the labor market remains tight and employers unwilling to let workers go, layoffs dropped in September to 1.3 million, fewest since April. But the number of people quitting their jobs slipped in September to just below 4.1 million, still high by historical standards.\"By all the key metrics in this report, the labor market is resilient,'' said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \"Job openings still vastly outnumber unemployed workers, the quits rate remains elevated and layoffs are still well below pre-pandemic levels.''To combat higher prices, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark interest rate five times this year and is expected to deliver another increase Wednesday and again at its meeting in December. The central bank is aiming for a so-called soft landing -- raising rates just enough to slow economic growth and bring inflation down without causing a recession.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed hope that inflationary pressure can be relieved by employers cutting job openings, not jobs.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Former U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who led Britain's response to COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic, was suspended by the Conservative Party on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022 after signing up to a reality TV show. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File)LONDON (AP) -- Former U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who led Britain's response to COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic, was suspended by the Conservative Party on Tuesday after signing up to a reality TV show.Hancock, who is no longer in government but remains a member of Parliament, is to compete on \"I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here.\" The show sends a group of famous people, often C-list celebrities, to the Australian rainforest, subjects them to trials involving spiders and snakes, and allows the public to vote them out one by one. Other contestants this year include Culture Club singer Boy George and former rugby player Mike Tindall, whose wife, Zara, is the niece of King Charles III.Conservative Chief Whip Simon Hart called Hancock's participation in the program \"a matter serious enough to warrant suspension of the whip with immediate effect.\" That means Hancock will not be part of the Conservative caucus in Parliament but will sit as an independent.Hancock quit as health secretary in June 2021 after breaching coronavirus lockdown rules by having an affair with an aide in his office - violating a ban on different households mixing.Hancock said he planned to use the show to raise awareness about dyslexia.A group that campaigns for relatives of people who died during the pandemic said Hancock should be \"seeking to reflect on the appalling consequences of his time in government.\" The U.K. has recorded almost 178,000 coronavirus deaths.\"My family was ripped apart by Matt Hancock's actions, and turning on the TV to see him being paraded around as a joke is sickening,\" Lobby Akinnola, a member of the group COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union for senior civil servants, also was unimpressed.\"Oh, to have a job where you can decide for yourself you're taking a month off, abandon your work and responsibilities, get paid shedloads and face little consequence,\" he said. \"I'm sure he'll be an inspiration to other public servants.\"Max Blain, the spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, said \"the prime minister believes that at a challenging time for the country, MPs should be working hard for their constituents.\" Blain said it was \"unlikely\" Sunak would watch \"I'm a Celebrity ...

All Rights Reserved.FILE - A health worker uses a pulse oximeter to check the oxygen saturation level of another after administering COVID-19 vaccine at a hospital in Gauhati, India, Jan. 21, 2021. The clip-on devices that use light to try to determine levels of oxygen in the blood are getting a closer look from U.S. regulators after recent studies suggest they don't work as well for patients of color. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath, File)NEW YORK (AP) -- The clip-on devices that use light to measure oxygen levels in the blood are getting a closer look from U.S. regulators after recent studies suggest they don't work as well for patients of color. The devices, called pulse oximeters, usually snap onto a finger and are widely used in hospitals across the globe to help guide treatment. At-home versions became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.But several recent studies have raised concerns that the pigmentation in people's skin can throw off the readings. In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about possible inaccuracies after a study found the devices tended to overestimate Black patients' oxygen levels.\"The fact that such a commonly used device could have any discrepancy at all was shocking to me,\" said Michael Sjoding, a University of Michigan pulmonologist who led the study. \"I make a lot of medical decisions based on this device.\"The FDA has convened a panel of experts to meet Tuesday to discuss \"ongoing concerns\" about the devices, recommendations for patients and doctors, and ways to gauge accuracy. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, called racial disparities in these devices \"of great public health importance\" at the beginning of the meeting Tuesday. He stressed the need to make sure medical devices are safe and effective for all the groups who use them.Oxygen levels can also be measured by drawing blood out of an artery in the wrist. This method is still the \"gold standard\" for accuracy, but is a bit trickier and more painful so can't be done as often, said Leo Celi, a physician and MIT researcher who is studying pulse oximetry.By comparison, pulse oximeters are quicker, easier and less invasive. When the device snaps onto a finger, it sends two wavelengths of light into the skin, explained Rutendo Jakachira, a doctoral student at Brown University who is researching pulse oximetry. By measuring how much of that light is absorbed, the pulse oximeter estimates how much oxygen is flowing through the blood. The problem: Melanin -- a natural pigment responsible for skin tone -- also absorbs light, Jakachira said. And if devices aren't built with melanin in mind, the extra absorption can throw off their readings.Mounting evidence suggests this seems to be affecting the pulse oximeters on the market.Sjoding's study found that compared to white patients, Black patients in the hospital were almost three times as likely to experience \"occult hypoxemia\" -- meaning their oxygen levels calculated from blood draws were dangerously low, but their pulse oximeter readings were still normal.Follow-up research showed these errors can have real impacts on health. When patients didn't have their low oxygen levels recognized, it meant delays in COVID-19 treatment, less supplemental oxygen and a higher risk of organ failure and mortality, according to several recent studies. All of these outcomes affected patients of color more often, the research found. For many doctors, the idea that the tools they rely on could be adding to racial discrepancies came as a shock.\"These are fundamental vital signs that we use for patient care,\" Sjoding said. \"And so if the device is even a small bit less accurate in a particular group of patients, that's going to have consequences.\"Small studies in past decades had hinted that skin tone might pose a challenge for the devices, but the concerns apparently \"fell by the wayside,\" said Johns Hopkins physician Ashraf Fawzy, who led one of the recent pulse oximeter studies. He and other doctors said they had never learned about racial gaps in pulse oximeters during their medical training.But the COVID-19 pandemic brought more attention to the devices -- and to issues of racial inequality in the health system.\"Now we're more acutely aware of how health care disparities impact people of color,\" Fawzy said. \"We're really motivated to actually solve these problems, and make health care more equitable for everyone.\"Some device companies have pushed back on the suggestion that their pulse oximeters are less accurate for patients of color. Masimo CEO Joe Kiani, whose company sells pulse oximeters to hospitals, said an internal review of their devices didn't find evidence of a significant difference in accuracy for Black patients. He says other variables, like a delay between pulse oximeter readings and blood draws, might have affected recent studies of pulse oximeter accuracy.Still, others are developing new devices that aim to work better for different skin tones. Jakachira and her advisor, Kimani Toussaint, are working on a modified pulse oximeter that still shines light into the skin to measure oxygen, but looks at different properties of that light.While technological solutions are still in the works, experts say it is important for health care workers to know the readings can be inaccurate. Sjoding said he's started to rely less on pulse oximeter readings in his own practice. He still uses them, but as one data point that may not be perfect.Some experts hoped that updated testing guidance from the FDA -- like more specific rules on who should be included in studies -- could help make sure future pulse oximeters work for everyone. The current standards suggest at least 15 of a trial group should have \"darkly pigmented\" skin.It may be an \"uphill battle\" to change devices like the pulse oximeter, said A. Ian Wong, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Duke University -- but he thinks it's a necessary step to provide equal care to all patients.\"Medicine is a bit of an art and a science,\" Wong said. \"It's more than just how a doctor practices; it's also the tools you use.\"------The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

All Rights Reserved.SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A health emergency has been declared in Southern California's Orange County due to rapidly spreading viral infections that are sending more children to the hospital, health officials said Tuesday.The county health officer issued the declaration Monday due to record numbers of pediatric hospitalizations and daily emergency room visits, the county's health care agency said in a press release. The move allows the county of 3 million people to access state and federal resources and enlist assistance from non-pediatric hospitals to help care for sick children, said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county's health officer.\"Our concern here is that it is reaching even record levels,\" Chinsio-Kwong told reporters. \"We want to make sure we are prepared to care for any sick child in the county who falls ill and requires hospital care.\" The county has seen a growing number of children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems for babies, while flu cases are also starting to rise. The situation is similar in much of the country where doctors are bracing for the possibility that RSV, flu and COVID-19 could combine to stress hospitals.Last week, neighboring San Diego County's public health agency sounded a similar alarm.In Orange County, the main children's hospital and a smaller pediatric hospital facility are operating at or above capacity, and the main campus has obtained waivers to put beds in different areas to handle the influx, said Melanie Patterson, vice president of patient care services and chief nursing officer at Children's Health of Orange County, which reported a spike in RSV cases to 186 last week.Wait times can range from four to 12 hours, she said. Health care officials urged parents to not let that dissuade them from bringing in children showing signs of respiratory distress and said they're triaging patients to get the sickest seen quickly while staff keep watch on those waiting in the lobby to ensure they're safe.Chinsio-Kwong said children and at-risk individuals should keep up to date on flu and COVID-19 vaccinations, wear masks indoors and stay home when sick.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The songwriting and producing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, whose chart-topping pop hits include Blige's \"No More Drama,\" Janet Jackson's \"When I Think of You,\" and Mariah Carey's \"Thank God I Found You,\" will be inducted into The Rock  Roll Hall of Fame. (AP Photo)NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rock  Roll Hall of Fame this year will induct Eminem, Dolly Parton, Lionel Richie, Carly Simon and two guys in sunglasses who have scored more No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100 than all of those other acts combined.Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are the rare songwriting and producing team to get into the prestigious hall, and they hope it will lead to more artists like them being inducted.\"Songwriters are like farmers,\" said Jam. \"When you go to a nice restaurant, the chef is like the artist and you thank him for the meal. But where did he get the food from? Without the farmer, he doesn't have any food to cook. And that's the way songwriters are to me.\"The duo's chart-topping pop hits include Janet Jackson's \"When I Think of You;\" Mariah Carey's \"Thank God I Found You;\" George Michael's \"Monkey;\" Boyz II Men's \"On Bended Knee;\" Janet and Michael Jackson's \"Scream;\" and Mary J. Blige's \"No More Drama.\" They have five Grammys and went into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2017.\"I don't know if you could ever recognize songwriters enough. I mean, they are the fuel that fuels everything,\" said Lewis. \"There are great songwriters out there that never get the shine that they deserve.\"One song in particular might typify the Jam and Lewis range -- \"Got 'Til It's Gone,\" which combines a folk sample from Joni Mitchell, the hip-hop of Q-Tip and Janet Jackson's RB voice. \"We're kind of at a crossroads or an intersection of a lot of different music,\" said Jam.Jam and Lewis started out in competing bands and became part of Prince's band, The Time, in Minneapolis. After parting ways with The Purple One, the duo established a recording studio and production company. Their collaboration with Janet Jackson on her monster albums \"Control\" and \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" solidified them as hitmakers. The Rock Hall on Saturday will also induct Eurythmics, Duran Duran, Judas Priest, Harry Belafonte, Elizabeth Cotten and Pat Benatar. Jam anticipated that one act closely associated with the duo would be the one who inducts them but didn't go into specifics, raising speculation that it will be Janet Jackson.They credit music executive Clarence Avant and an earlier songwriting powerhouse duo, Gamble  Huff, for showing the way forward. They hope to do the same with their induction: \"It's wonderful and hopefully shines a spotlight on other people like us who do what we do that are deserving.\" They grew up listening to different genres. Jam was a pop fan, soaking in Seals and Crofts, America and Chicago. Lewis leaned more toward Parliament-Funkadelic and Earth, Wind  Fire. \"Terry liked the funky bottom. I like the pretty top,\" said Jam. You can hear that combo throughout their career, starting with their first hit, S.O.S. Band's \"Just Be Good to Me.\" They're responsible for more than 50 Billboard No. 1 songs on the pop, RB and dance charts for everyone from Rod Stewart and Sting to Patti LaBelle. They tailor the song to the artist and choose for themselves a non-nonsense wardrobe of black suits and sunglasses. Next year, they celebrate their partnership hitting its 50th anniversary.\"We're kind of at a point of our careers where we don't have anything to prove, but we still have a lot to say,\" said Jam. \"We just want to leave music in a better place, whether it's through technology, whether it's through the songs we make, whether it's the people we influence that are making music now.\"Turn on the radio and you will likely immediately hear the influence of Jam and Lewis. Famed Swedish producer Max Martin channeled the duo while crafting hits for Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. Charlie Puth is a fan, and Bruno Mars gave the pair a shout-out on the Grammy stage for paving the way when he won album of the year for \"24K Magic.\"One thing Jam and Lewis would like to see change is more recognition for the folks behind the tunes. Lewis worries that music today is often seen like a utility, a faceless service like water or electricity that's taken for granted. Jam misses the days when a record sleeve included tons of information about the music makers, like the name of the engineer and mixer.\"The reason we're writers and producers now is because we could look at records back in the day and instantly see who produced it and who wrote it,\" said Jam. These days, it's hard to find credits on streaming sites and the duo think that's a problem. \"What it does is it devalues the music because it communicates the idea that music just comes out of nowhere. It doesn't come out of nowhere. There's people in this,\" Jam said. After decades of making music for other people, Jam and Lewis last year made their debut album as artists, \"Jam and Lewis, Volume One\" featuring Babyface, Toni Braxton and Mariah Carey. They plan on more such albums and hope to perform live next year, too.The goal then -- as it always has been for these men who push the sonic envelope -- is to build a musical bridge in this time of divisions. \"It's all about taking people -- young, old, white, Black, straight, gay, Democrat or Republican, whatever -- and for the time we're on stage, bring all of them together,\" said Jam. \"If you could do that, that to me is the magic of music.\"Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwitsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The former assistant coach and son of head coach Andy Reid in September pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and causing a 2021 crash that severely injured a 5-year-old girl. (Tammy Ljungblad/The Kansas City Star via AP)KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid was sentenced on Tuesday to three years in prison for driving drunk, speeding and hitting two parked cars last year, leaving a 5-year-old girl with a serious brain injury.Reid pleaded guilty in September to driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury. The charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, but prosecutors had agreed to ask for a maximum sentence of four years in prison. Reid sought probation. The injured girl's family had opposed the plea deal.Circuit Judge Charles H. McKenzie sentenced Reid on Tuesday and he was set to be taken into custody.Prosecutors said Reid, the son of Chiefs Coach Andy Reid, was intoxicated and driving about 84 mph (135 kph) in a 65 mph zone when his Dodge truck hit the cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium on Feb. 4, 2021.A girl inside one of the cars, Ariel Young, suffered a traumatic brain injury. A total of six people, including Reid, were injured. One of the vehicles he hit had stalled because of a dead battery, and the second was owned by Ariel's mother, who had arrived to help.Reid had a blood-alcohol level of 0.113 two hours after the crash, police said. The legal limit is 0.08.After the sentencing, Ariel's family issued a statement through attorney Tom Porto saying they were outraged that Reid didn't get the full seven years allowed by law.\"No amount of prison time will ever be enough to punish the Defendant for the pain and suffering he caused this family and the ongoing difficulties that Ariel will continue to endure for the rest of her life,\" the statement said.Reid's attorney, J.R. Hobbs, said in a statement that Reid respects the court's decision. \"He sincerely regrets and accepts responsibility for his conduct and hopes and prays for (Ariel's) continued recovery,\" the statement said.Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said after the sentencing that she had been confident that Reid's notoriety would not influence the sentence. She had argued during the hearing that Reid should be sentenced to four years because he made a series of bad decisions that resulted in long-term pain to Ariel and her family. \"I think what happened today was justice,\" Peters Baker said. Before sentencing, a victim impact statement from Ariel's mother, Felicia Miller, was read into the record. She said the five victims of the crash were offended that Reid sought probation and they did not accept his apologies for his actions. Miller said her daughter, who was in court Tuesday, has improved but still drags one of her feet when she walks, will see a doctor about leg braces, has terrible balance and must wear thick eyeglasses.She noted that Reid had a prior conviction and has served time in prison for DUI.\"And he's asking for probation? On what planet does this conduct deserve probation? Can people really get drunk and give a 5-year-old a brain injury and think they should get probation?\" wrote Miller.Reid apologized before sentencing, turning to look at Ariel and her family as he spoke. He said he has a daughter the same age as Ariel and his family prays for her every night.\"I understand where Ms. Miller is coming from. I think I would feel the same way,\" he said.Reid underwent emergency surgery for a groin injury after the crash. The Chiefs placed him on administrative leave, and his job with the team ended after his contract was allowed to expire.This is not the first legal issue for Reid, who graduated from a drug treatment program in Pennsylvania in 2009 after a series of run-ins with law enforcement. His father was coach of the Philadelphia Eagles at the time.The Chiefs reached a confidential agreement with Ariel's family in November to pay for her ongoing medical treatment and other expenses.This story was first published Nov. 1, 2022. It was updated Nov. 2, 2022, to correct attribution of a quote in the 10th paragraph to a statement from Reid's attorney.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Indianapolis Colts offensive coordinator Marcus Brady walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, Sept. 18, 2022, in Jacksonville, Fla. Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich fired offensive coordinator Marcus Brady on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, two days after another subpar offensive showing in a loss to Washington. (AP Photo/Gary McCullough, File)INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich continued shaking up the offense Tuesday by firing offensive coordinator Marcus Brady.The move comes two days after another loss, 17-16 to Washington, in which the Colts scored just one touchdown and nine days after Reich announced a quarterback change. Brady, one of the few but expanding group of minority NFL coordinators, was promoted to the post last season when Nick Sirianni left Indy to take the Philadelphia Eagles head coaching job.\"This was an incredibly hard decision, but one I felt needed to be made in the best interest of the team,\" Reich said in a statement. \"I appreciate Marcus' commitment to the organization, and he made a significant contribution to our offensive success over the last five seasons. I wish him the best moving forward.\"Reich does not typically speak with reporters on Tuesdays when players are off. He is scheduled to talk again Wednesday, and the Colts canceled their usual Tuesday availability with coordinators.Indy (3-4-1) has lost two straight and is 2 1/2 games behind Tennessee in the AFC South, but just one game out of playoff position.The 43-year-old Brady was considered a rising star in the coaching ranks when Indy ranked second in the league in rushing (149.4 yards per game) and ninth in scoring (26.5) last year.But this season has been a struggle and Reich has made two uncharacteristic moves in two weeks, hoping to get the offense in gear.He benched starting quarterback Matt Ryan in favor of Sam Ehlinger last week with Ryan in the midst of possibly the worst season of his 15-year career. He was responsible for a league-leading 12 turnovers.Ehlinger was solid in his starting debut, completing 17 of 23 for 201 yards against Washington. The former Texas star was sacked twice, lost one fumble and did not throw a touchdown pass or interception but came up less than a yard short on a third down scramble with about 3 1/2 minutes to go -- a play that could have iced the win.Instead, the Colts opted to punt and Commanders quarterback Taylor Heinicke took advantage, capping the game-winning drive with a 1-yard TD run with 22 seconds left.But Brady wasn't the play-caller. Reich has held that job since returning to Indy 2018 so it's unclear how much will change when the Colts visit New England on Sunday.Indy's offense is ranked No. 18 in total yards, but has struggled to run the ball most of this season. It has 16 giveaways, tied for the most in the NFL with the Patriots and New Orleans Saints, and ranks 30th in scoring at 16.1 points.\"This morning we relieved Marcus Brady of his duties as offensive coordinator,\" team owner Jim Irsay wrote on Twitter. \"I wish this good man all the best.Reich hired Brady in 2018 as quarterbacks coach and he worked with six different starters during that span -- Andrew Luck, Jacoby Brissett, Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, Ryan and now Ehlinger. Before joining the Colts, Brady played seven seasons in the Canadian Football League. He started his coaching career with the Montreal Alouettes then spent five seasons with the Toronto Argonauts and won the Grey Cup in 2017 before moving to Indy. Brady also won two Grey Cups as a player after playing at Cal State Northridge. AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- SpaceX launched its mega Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time in more than three years Tuesday, hoisting satellites for the military and then nailing side-by-side booster landings back near the pad.Thick fog shrouded NASA's Kennedy Space Center as the rocket blasted off at midmorning. The crowd at the launch site couldn't even see the pad three miles (5 kilometers) away, but heard the roar of the 27 first-stage engines. Both side boosters peeled away two minutes after liftoff, flew back to Cape Canaveral, and landed alongside one another, just a few seconds apart. The core stage was discarded at sea, its entire energy needed to get the Space Force's satellites to their intended extra-high orbit. This was SpaceX's fourth flight of a Falcon Heavy, currently the most powerful rocket in use. The first, in 2018, launched SpaceX chief Elon Musk's red Tesla convertible; the next two Heavy launches followed in 2019, lifting satellites.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

All Rights Reserved.This photo shows the cover of \"Emily Post's Etiquette, The Centennial Edition\" By Lizzie Post and Daniel Post Senning. The grande dame of all things manners died in 1960 but her two descendants have overhauled her lasting book of tips for the 21st century. (The Emily Post Institute/Ten Speed Press via AP)NEW YORK (AP) -- Embracing without permission. Disparaging one parent in front of children struggling with divorce. Flaunting privilege. Being a bad listener or, worse, a terrible loser. The world and all its interactional black holes would likely have Emily Post spewing her tea. The grande dame of all things manners died in 1960, but two of her descendants have overhauled her book of tips for the 21st century to mark the centennial of the first edition.\"I think mostly that it's really easy to paint etiquette and manners as tools for elitism, tools for secrecy, tools for exclusion,\" said Lizzie Post, Emily's great-great-granddaughter and co-author of the latest \"Emily Post's Etiquette.\" \"And when they are used that way, and they definitely can be, they are effectively useless. But when we're using etiquette and manners as a tool for self-reflection and awareness of others, I think we're really going to have a chance to make the world a nicer place,\" she said.As incivility has taken an even stronger hold on the culture, the newfangled book encourages patience and humility in talking over difficult subjects. That, it notes, requires \"getting comfortable with the idea that your brilliant remark could go unsaid.\" The book also pleads for grace in losing and a \"good apology,\" avoiding the word \"if\" to neutralize the effort, or \"but\" to dig your hole deeper.Emily published her first version of the book under a different title in 1922 after making a name for herself as a novelist and travelogue writer. It's been freshened through the decades, but the 20th edition out in October is a comprehensive update. There's plenty of advice on setting tables, dressing for different occasions, and basic courtesies on things like gifting, tipping and greetings. But Lizzie Post, and her cousin and co-author, Daniel Post Senning, have taken on issues far more crucial. They've done it in part by crowdsourcing, including ideas from callers to their Awesome Etiquette podcast.And they did it in the middle of a pandemic and the MeToo movement, both recognized in subjects like optional handshakes, or seeking permission to hug or kiss on the cheek.\"The hug is such an intimate gesture that, for some, an unwanted one can feel like a violation,\" the new book notes in part. \"When someone doesn't ask, pushes for one, or even forces it, they're communicating that because they think it's okay, they get to press their body against someone else's. Depending on how it's done, it can cross over into sexual harassment or assault.\"Not exactly groundbreaking, unless written under the name of Emily Post.Emily herself was born into East Coast privilege, growing up in Baltimore and New York City. Her father was a prominent architect for the rich, who designed the tony enclave of Tuxedo Park, New York, and her mother was the daughter of a coal baron. Emily met her husband, Edward, at a Fifth Avenue ball. There was scandal involving his romantic dalliances with chorus girls and actresses, resulting in a divorce announced in 1906, according to a biographer and reports at the time. Her inner circle attempted to secure her privacy after that, and her descendants have some wise words for friends and family offering sympathy today in divorces and separations.\"Avoid trying to push or suggest the right decision for a friend,\" the Posts write in the new book. \"It's especially important to be careful what you say around children whose parents are separated or divorcing. Cheering the news or making negative comments is unnecessary.\"The book takes on other losses often left unaddressed in Emily's time, such as grieving a miscarriage.\"You absolutely want to avoid saying things such as, Next time it'll happen,'\" or This just wasn't your time,'\" the book counsels.Through her travels, Emily learned more about the lives of those outside her social milieu. By 1922, she wrote in the first chapter of the book's first edition, what was then called \"Best Society\" wasn't a group born into great wealth or status but one comprised of \"gentlefolk\" who take care of each other.\"Best Society,\" she wrote, \"is not at all like a court with an especial queen or king, nor is it confined to any one place or group, but might be better described as an unlimited brotherhood which spreads over the entire surface of the globe, the members of which are invariably people of cultivation and worldly knowledge, who have not only perfect manners, but a perfect manner.\"Her descendants take on privilege this way: \"Privilege can be and sound like many different things, but in conversation, it mostly comes across as a lack of awareness that you have benefited in a way others may not have.\"Modern-day manners on pronouns are also addressed in the new book, as a way to show \"support, respect, and basic courtesy.\"\"You might think someone's pronouns are easy enough to tell just by looking at them, but the reality is this isn't always the case,\" the Posts write. \"If you don't know someone's pronouns, and you need to know them in order to make an introduction, asking is the polite thing to do: Joan, what pronouns do you use?' Note that you don't ask what pronouns Joan prefers' -- an unfortunately common construction for this question.\"Emily was 87 when she died. Ironically, Lizzie Post said in an interview, \"the older she got, the less she enjoyed participating in society. ... She felt, I think, a lot of autonomy and a lot of power and a lot of agency in just being able to stay home and not have it be a big deal.\"Expanding her empire all the while with other books of etiquette.As an only child, Emily was a \"daddy's girl,\" Lizzie said, and losing her father in 1903 was a blow. Other tragedies followed. Her mother was killed in a car accident in 1909. One of her two sons, Bruce, grew up to be an architect like her father but died at 32 of appendicitis as the two worked together on a house in Martha's Vineyard. That's where she summered as she continued to write new books and churn out editions of her etiquette bible.With her surviving son, Ned, she founded The Emily Post Institute in 1946, and the family still runs it today.In print, Emily grew \"more inclusive over the years,\" said Lizzie. Emily's etiquette became based more on education and merit than ideology and socioeconomic status, she said.For that, Lizzie said, \"I'm happy.\"Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalieCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona voters who began mailing in their ballots after simply signing and dating the envelope in recent weeks might be doing so for the final time with that simple process.That's because one of 10 measures they'll decide in the Nov. 8 midterm elections would change the rules for verifying that the people who mail in such ballots are who they say they are. Proposition 309 would also change how in-person voters are allowed to prove their identity. Three other measures also placed on the ballot by Republicans who control the Legislature would make major changes to the citizen initiative process by making it harder for voters to bypass lawmakers and write their own laws. One would carve out major exemptions to the Voter Protection Act, which prevents the Legislature from changing voter-approved laws in most cases. The four measures target early-voting and voter ID laws in the name of election security. They are priorities for Republicans, who have long chafed at the citizen initiative process.The voting measure, Proposition 309, would require voters to write their birthdates and add state-issued voter identification numbers, driver license of identification numbers or a partial social security numbers to affidavits rather than just signing and dating them. The back-of-envelope signature used by many counties also would be changed to require that they be placed into a second envelope.In-person voting requirements also would change, eliminating the ability of voters who don't have a state, tribal or federal government-issued photo ID on them to vote by presenting two alternate documents, such as a utility bill.Democrats and voting rights groups note that citizenship and other requirements for voting are already done during the voter registration process and that the changes would lead to more mail-in ballots being rejected and people being turned away at the polls. Republicans say they're needed election security changes. The three constitutional amendments targeting initiatives are Propositions 128, 129 and 132. The first would free the Legislature from the Voter Protection Act's ban on changing laws passed by initiative if any part of the measure is found by the state Supreme Court or U.S. Supreme Court to contain illegal or unconstitutional language. Currently, only that portion would be stricken, but if Proposition 128 passes, lawmakers could make wholesale changes or even repeal such laws. Proposition 129 would limit initiatives to a single subject and require that all major parts of an initiative be explained in the title, voiding any part not explained there. Many initiatives that have already been enacted cover more than a single subject, and opponents say passage of Proposition 129 would limit comprehensive measures and lead to lawsuits challenging whether a measure truly only covers one subject.Proposition 132 would raise the threshold from a simple majority to 60 of the vote to pass any ballot measure that would raise taxes or impose a fee. Proponents say that's important since tax increases deserve greater support to pass, but opponents note that many initiatives contain fees or taxes to support their objectives, such as the Clean Elections Act, which funds candidates for office who forego private funding by using a 10 surcharge levied on all civil and criminal penalties.At least two ballot measures this year -- one that would raise taxes for rural fire districts and another that would limit interest and making other changes to debt owed by Arizonans -- would need 60 of voter support in future elections if they pass.Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - The Treasury Building is viewed in Washington, May 4, 2021. The U.S. hit three more Iranian security officials with financial sanctions Wednesday in response to the Iranian government's continued crackdown on protests over the September death of 22 year-old Mahsa Amini. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control says the Iranian regime has increased its aggressive actions against its citizens \"as part of its ongoing suppression of peaceful protests against a regime that denies human rights and fundamental freedoms to its people, especially women and girls.\" (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against a weapons trafficking network affiliated with the Islamic State group in Somalia and the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which are accused of carrying out deadly terrorist acts on civilians including car bombings.The move to freeze and block any potential transactions with U.S. entities comes after two car bombings at a busy junction in Somalia's capital on Saturday killed at least 120 people. Al-Shabab, which often targets the capital, Mogadishu, and controls large parts of the country, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its objective was to hit the education ministry.These are the first sanctions on Somalia's Islamic State group network from Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The State Department designated IS-Somalia in 2018 as \"Specially Designated Global Terrorists.\"White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday said the sanctions were intended to underscore the administration's commitment to helping Somalia in its fight against terrorism.He said the Treasury Department sanctions \"aimed to expose and disrupt a broad network of weapons traffickers, their associates and an affiliated business operating primarily between Yemen and Somalia.\"On Oct. 17, the U.S. imposed financial penalties on more than a dozen people from Somalia and Yemen who it said were involved in al-Shabab's financing operations. Those funds are used to help with weapons procurement and recruitment activities.Violent acts have increased in recent months. Islamic extremist fighters in early October targeted a Somali government headquarters in the Hiran region, leaving at least 20 people dead and 36 wounded in a town at the center of a recent mobilization against the extremists. Saturday's bombing in Mogadishu injured more than 320 people, and some were still missing.\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to all who lost loved ones and were injured in Saturday's horrific attack and strongly condemn this indefensible act of terrorism,\" Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said. \"Today, we take direct aim at the networks funding and supplying both ISIS-Somalia and al-Shabaab that support their violent acts.\"The Islamic State group sometimes is known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. ISIS-Somalia is a far smaller operation than al-Shabab, with members numbering in the hundreds as opposed to several thousand at least for al-Shabab. Both engage in extortion and have competed for business, even killing members of the other group at times. The sanctions announcement gives insight into links between the groups.The weapons networks targeted by the sanctions \"operate primarily between Yemen and Somalia and have strong ties to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and al-Shabab,\" the Treasury Department said. But one person sanctioned, Osama Abdelmongy Abdalla Bakr, went as far as to pursue contacts with North Korean officials in search of weapons and support, it said. \"ISIS did not receive lightweight weapons, anti-drone technology, or anything else from the DPRK,\" also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Treasury said.The announcement also gives a glimpse into smuggling operations. One sanctioned ISIS-Somalia member, Abdirahman Mohamed Omar, takes AK-47 assault rifles and machine guns out of nearby Yemen and hides them under ice and fish, and in Somalia the weapons are hidden in sugar and rice sacks and loaded onto camels for delivery to al-Shabab and ISIS-Somalia, the announcement said.Also sanctioned was Mohamed Ahmed Qahiye, the head of ISIS-Somalia's intelligence wing, the Amniyat.Anna contributed from Nairobi, Kenya.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)Dustin Johnson says his hands \"were not real steady\" over a 3-foot par putt at Doral for the final meaningful stroke of a LIV Golf season in constant search of meaning.The putt meant more to his team than to someone who had made more than 100 million in 15 years on the PGA Tour, and who was about to make 35 million more in five months.\"That was a little more stress than I was looking for,\" Johnson said.How steady were those hands on that 3-foot putt on the bumpy 18th green at Chambers Bay that cost him the 2015 U.S. Open?That's a question for cynics of Saudi-funded LIV Golf who aren't sure what to make of the new league. That's because golf has never seen a model such as this with team scores and 48-man fields and shotgun starts. It certainly hasn't seen this amount of guaranteed money.LIV Golf went from \"dead in the water\" in February to launching its 54-hole product with a shotgun start in June to joining the antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour in August to a final event Sunday decided by Johnson and Cameron Smith, its best two players.And now it goes away for three months -- gone, but not silent.Still to come is the 2023 schedule expected by the end of the month, and more Saudi cash thrown at PGA Tour players to try to lure them away to a league where the money is real and the relevance is to be determined.It has time on its side. \"We're not going anywhere\" has become the latest mantra for LIV Golf, and it's far more legitimate than \"golf is a force for good.\"LIV Golf has unlimited money that has bought everything but credibility. One measure of success will be how badly it is missed when it starts up again, and even that will be hard to appraise because so few people were watching in the first place.Finding a broadcast partner, even if LIV Golf has to buy time, will be more valuable than any other player it can sign. \"We have to start commercializing the product,\" Atul Khosla, the president and COO of LIV Golf, told reporters at Doral. \"Got to get on TV. Need to get corporate partners. These are milestones that we need to hit.\"The plan is for 12 teams, four players and one reserve. The league will be based on a franchise model, with the captain getting a 25 stake and taking part ownership in building the team brand.As critical as it is to get a television deal, equally important is corporate sponsorship, and that will take companies willing to accept being linked to the league's source of funding from the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund.Another hurdle is the Official World Golf Ranking, which might only be relevant depending on how the major championships determine their criteria. If nothing changes, as many as 12 players from LIV Golf would be eligible for the Masters. At least four others are likely to fall out of the top 50 in the world by the end of the year, a key category for Augusta National.The USGA (U.S. Open) and Royal  Ancient Golf Club (British Open) are not expected to announce qualifying criteria until sometime early next year.RA chief Martin Slumbers tipped his hand in an interview with Golf Digest.\"We're not banning anyone,\" Slumbers said. \"We are not going to betray 150 years of history and have the Open not be open. The name says it all. And that's important.\"The majors suddenly have more power than ever in golf. The PGA Tour has suspended players who join LIV Golf, while the European tour is waiting on the courts early next year to decide whether it can similarly punish such players.If that's the case, the majors might be the only golf tournaments all year that bring together the best from every tour.\"Maybe the consequence of where we are is that we only get to see all of the very best players together four times a year,\" Slumbers said. \"So we'll enjoy it four times a year.\"LIV Golf signed up 26 players who were among the top 100 at the end of last year. Without access to ranking points, seven players (including Bryson DeChambeau) have dropped out of the top 50 and nine (including Phil Mickelson) are now out of the top 100.If LIV Golf marches on in a team concept, should the world ranking even matter to them? At that point, it's only about access to the majors.The biggest hurdle of all might be the stigma that this is more about entertainment than sport. Players are happier, and there are plenty of reasons for that. They're getting more money than ever. They only play 54 holes without a cut. Gone is the cut-throat competition so many faced on established tours. That's what golf was.For the majority of fans, that's what golf still is.AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Rafael Nadal, of Spain, celebrates after winning his match against Richard Gasquet, of France, during the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022, in New York. On Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022, Spanish media reported Mery Perello, Nadal's wife, gave birth to a baby boy, the couple's first child. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger, File)PARIS (AP) -- Rafael Nadal is a different man. He's losing sleep over his newborn baby and not so much the No. 1 ranking.Even with all of his absences, Nadal has a shot at finishing the season as the world No. 1. He has racked up 5,820 points, trailing only the top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz, who has 6,650. But Nadal made clear on Tuesday what his priorities were when he was peppered with questions about fighting for the year-end No. 1 spot.There will be no fight.Nadal has achieved the coveted year-end No. 1 ranking five times, tied with Roger Federer, and trailing only Novak Djokovic (7) and Pete Sampras (6).\"I don't fight to be No. 1,\" Nadal said at a Paris Masters news conference. \"Something that I said since long time ago: I will not fight anymore to be No. 1. I did in the past. I achieved that goal a couple of times in my career that I have been very, very happy and proud about. But I am in a moment of my tennis career that I don't fight to be No. 1.\"For now, he wants to be a No. 1 dad.He's come to Paris for his first tournament since his wife Maria Francisca Perello gave birth to their first child -- a boy -- in early October. Nadal admitted he's approaching things differently now that he's a father.\"It's quite interesting how, even after (knowing him only) two or three weeks, leave your son at home and not be able to see him . . . you start missing him,\" Nadal said. \"We are lucky today that, with the technology, everything, we can do video calls any time that you want.\"Nadal received a first-round bye and will face Tommy Paul or Roberto Bautista Agut in the second round on Wednesday. He hasn't played competitively since September when he partnered with Federer in doubles at the Laver Cup to celebrate the last match of the retiring Swiss great.Nadal won the Australian Open and French Open this year to achieve a record 22 Grand Slam singles titles, one more than Djokovic and two more than Federer. But the vibe on tour is a changing of the guard, with 36-year-old Nadal passing the baton to 19-year-old Alcaraz, at least in their Spain homeland.Nadal has struggled with injuries and played only 10 tournaments. He suffered a stress fracture in his ribs at Indian Wells in March. Then an abdominal injury forced him to pull out of the Wimbledon semifinals and affected him the whole summer. \"It's obvious that when I was No. 1 for the first time in my career in 2008, I really wanted to be there,\" Nadal said, \"because I felt that 2005, '06, '07, including '08, I was doing amazing results, winning a lot of tournaments, having a lot of points on the ranking system.\"Today is a different story for me. I don't know how many events I played, like 10, and I finished eight. Difficult to be No. 1 like this. But happy to be in that position that says when I was playing, I was playing well.\"Alcaraz became the youngest men's No. 1 in the 50-year history of the ATP rankings in September when he won his first major crown at the U.S. Open.\"It was my dream to win a Grand Slam, to become No. 1 of the world, but I didn't expect to do that at 19 years old,\" Alcaraz said. \"Everything came so fast, faster than I could imagine.\"Alcaraz is set to clinch the year-end No. 1 for the first time. He could be the first player to achieve that outside the Big Four of Nadal, Djokovic, Federer and Andy Murray since Andy Roddick in 2003.No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas and No. 4 Casper Ruud have an outside chance at No. 1 as 1,000 points go to the Paris Masters winner and 1,500 points for a perfect run at the ATP Finals in Turin this month.

All Rights Reserved.PARIS (AP) -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic started his chase for a record-extending 39th Masters title by beating Maxime Cressy of the United States 7-6 (1), 6-4 in the second round of the Paris Masters on Tuesday. In the first meeting between the two, the big-serving Cressy saved three break points in the eighth game but then hit two double-faults in the tiebreaker, which Djokovic won with an ace.Cressy also double-faulted at 4-4 in the second set to hand two break points to Djokovic, who broke with a forehand return winner. The Serb converted his first match point with a backhand volley. \"Difficult to play him definitely in these kind of conditions where balls are flying through the court and it's quicker than it was last year,\" Djokovic said. \"So tough to break.\"Djokovic faced no break points and made only three unforced errors to 14 for Cressy. After lifting trophies in Israel and Kazakhstan, Djokovic stretched his winning streak to 10 matches since a loss at the Laver Cup in September. He will next play Karen Khachanov, who outlasted Marc-Andrea Huesler 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Casper Ruud also moved into the third round by defeating wild-card entry Richard Gasquet 6-1, 7-6 (7), while Holger Rune saved three match points in a 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3) win over Stan Wawrinka.The third-seeded Ruud raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening set and broke back at 5-3 in the second to force a tiebreaker. Gasquet squandered a set point at 7-6 by netting a forehand volley.Ruud snapped a poor run of form after losing in the first round of the Basel and Tokyo tournaments. Meanwhile, Andrey Rublev and Hubert Hurkacz stayed in contention for the two remaining spots at the ATP Finals.Rublev cruised past John Isner 6-2, 6-3 in the second round while Hurkacz edged wild-card entry Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (5), 6-4 in the first round. The seventh-seeded Rublev beat Isner for the first time in four meetings. Isner dropped serve twice in the opening set and Rublev capitalized on three forehand errors by the American to break for a 3-1 lead in the second.\"From the baseline I was feeling really confident,\" Rublev said. \"As soon as I was returning or the ball was in the game, I feel like I have always advantage, I was not even nervous.\" Isner hit 11 aces, but Rublev did not face any break points and proved the better player in rallies, making only five unforced errors to 13.Rublev currently occupies the last ATP Finals spot ahead of Fritz and Hurkacz.Carlos Alcaraz, Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ruud, Daniil Medvedev and Djokovic have already qualified for the eight-man tournament. Hurkacz served 20 aces, including on both set points, and saved all eight break points he faced. Hurkacz hit a forehand return winner for a 5-4 lead in the second set to convert his only break point of the match. In other first-round matches, No. 14 seed Pablo Carreno Busta ousted Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-3, 6-3, French qualifier Corentin Moutet stunned Borna Coric 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, Daniel Evans overcame Brandon Nakashima 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, Jack Draper beat Arthur Rinderknech 6-3, 6-4, lucky loser Fabio Fognini defeated Arthur Fils 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-2. Tommy Paul, Denis Shapovalov and Grigor Dimitrov also advanced to the second round. Paul dispatched Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 to set up a match against Nadal, Shapovalov rallied past Francisco Cerundolo 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4, and Dimitrov edged Botic van de Zandschulp 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5).

Their spending has driven a strong recovery -- and ignited inflationary pressures. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson, File)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Help-wanted signs are everywhere. Employers are posting nearly two job openings for every unemployed American. Hiring is on track for its second-strongest year in government records dating to 1940. And the economy grew solidly over the summer.From certain angles, the nation's economic picture looks like a healthy one.But the scene is being photo-bombed by an unsightly intruder: Chronically high inflation. Surging prices are straining family budgets and inflicting hardship on the most economically disadvantaged households. What's more, the Federal Reserve's drive to tame inflation through much higher interest rates is raising the risk of a recession by next year.With voting underway in the midterm congressional elections that culminate next week, many Americans are gloomy about the outlook for the economy and their own finances -- encouraging news for Republicans who hope to regain control of Congress and ominous news for President Joe Biden's congressional Democrats. A poll conducted in early October by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 46 of people felt their personal financial situations were poor, up from 37 who said so in March.America's economy is in a confusing place 2 1/2 years after COVID-19 upended business as usual. The brief but deep recession that erupted in the spring of 2020 was swiftly followed by an explosive recovery that overwhelmed global supply chains, causing shortages of goods and labor and fueling price pressures that have yet to ebb. What remains is an unusual blend of crushing inflation and a robust job market. \"The data,'' said economist Megan Greene of the Kroll Institute, \"is all over the map.'' Many workers have received decent pay raises from employers who are desperate to attract and keep staffers. But higher prices are wiping out those pay gains. Adjusted for inflation, hourly pay fell 3 in September from a year earlier -- the 18th straight monthly drop.\"Wage growth isn't keeping pace,'' Greene said. \"It's great that people have jobs. But their standards of living are being whittled by inflation.''Here's a closer look at the economy's vital signs, which are sending mixed signals to policymakers, businesses, forecasters -- and voters:Perhaps no economic barometer has been as head-scratching as the gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services. After surging 5.9 last year, the best mark since 1984, GDP fell into a funk in the first half of this year. It shrank at a 1.6 annual rate from January through March and then by 0.6 from April through June.The first-half economic contraction was caused by factors that didn't really reveal much about the health of the underlying economy. The decline was driven by a drop in companies' inventories, a cyclical development that often reverses itself soon after, and a surge in imports, which reflected Americans' keen appetite for foreign goods.Last week, the government reported that GDP returned to growth in the July-September quarter, expanding at a solid 2.6 annual rate. Yet the new picture wasn't entirely cause for celebration. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 of U.S. economic activity, weakened last quarter: It rose at just a 1.4 annual rate, down from a 2 rate in the April-June period. The entire third-quarter increase in GDP could be attributed to a jump in exports and lower imports, which together added nearly 2.8 percentage points of growth. That performance isn't likely to be repeated. A stronger dollar has made American goods pricier overseas. And Russia's war against Ukraine has contributed to a weakening global economy and lower demand for U.S. goods.\"If you look under the hood on those third-quarter figures,\" Greene said, \"it suggests that it wasn't that strong, and we can't expect it to continue.\"The economic outlook is also darkening as the Fed steadily jacks up interest rates. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark rate five times, including three straight hefty three-quarter-point hikes. It's expected to do so again on Wednesday and in December.The Fed's policymakers have been aiming for a \"soft landing'' -- raising rates enough to slow growth and bring inflation toward its 2 annual target without triggering a recession in the process. Most economists, though, doubt it can be done. They foresee a recession beginning sometime in 2023.One reason for widespread skepticism about the Fed's ability to stick a soft landing is that inflation is proving harder to defeat than policymakers had expected. The result is that more and larger rate hikes than originally envisioned will likely be required. In September, the government's consumer price index rose a higher-than-expected 0.4 from August and 8.2 from a year earlier. Worse, so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs to better assess price pressures, climbed 6.6 from a year earlier. That was the biggest such jump in 40 years. What's more, high inflation is hardly confined to the United States. In the 19 countries that share the euro currency, for example, prices soared 9.9 in September from a year earlier. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven up energy prices and disrupted food supplies. In the United States, inflation has not only stayed high but has broadened from the goods sector of the economy to the much larger service sector -- a vast area that includes everything from air fares, auto insurance and medical care to hotel rates, apartment rents and restaurant meals. Problem is, the farther inflation spreads, the harder it is to control.The job market is the clear star of the American economy.Employers have shrugged off surging prices, rising interest rates and fears of a coming recession and just kept hiring. After adding a record 6.7 million jobs last year, the economy has tacked on a robust monthly average of 420,000 so far this year. The unemployment rate in September, 3.5, matched a half-century low.Still, the employment market is cooling. Job gains have slowed for two straight months -- to 263,000 in September from 315,000 in August and 537,000 in July. Employers posted 10.7 million job openings in October, the government reported Tuesday. That was up from 10.3 million, though down from a peak of 11.9 million in March. By historical standards, those figures were uncommonly high: For 15 straight months, openings have topped 10 million, a level they had never reached before 2021.Americans are also enjoying extraordinary job security. Employers are shedding a monthly average of fewer than 1.4 million workers -- on pace to surpass last year for the fewest layoffs in government records dating to 2001. The job market, though, is expected to deteriorate as the Fed's rate hikes begin to bite.American consumers, the lifeblood of the economy, have proved resilient through the ups and downs of the COVID economy. Their spending has both driven a strong recovery and ignited inflationary pressures.Though higher prices have sapped their spending power, and the federal relief checks of 2020 and 2021 are long gone, Americans have kept spending, though at a moderating pace. Consumer spending rose 0.3 from August to September, even after accounting for inflation, the government reported.It isn't certain that consumers can keep it up. They have collectively used up much of the savings they amassed during pandemic, though their finances are still relatively strong, and are increasingly turning to credit cards. The U.S. savings rate has declined. \"It's clear that the economy is slowing,'' Kroll's Greene said. \"The question is how quickly. And the other question is, at what point businesses and consumers feel like they need to retrench. And that's more a question of psychology than it is of economics.\"For now, businesses and consumers have enough cash on hand to keep on spending. They don't have to cut back right away:\"But they might do so anyhow because there's all this talk of a downturn coming and given there's so much uncertainty in the economy.''The Fed's rate hikes have already claimed a victim: America's housing market is reeling under the strain of drastically higher mortgage rates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, which was just 3.14 a year ago, topped 7 last week for the first time since 2002. Sales of existing homes have fallen for eight straight months.The GDP report showed that housing investment plunged at a 26 annual pace from July through September. And housing construction in September was down 8 from a year earlier.Home prices are still rising, supported by a limited number of houses on the market. But price increases are decelerating. The SP CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of home price in 20 U.S. cities rose 13 in August from a year earlier. Still, that marked a slowdown from a 16 year-over-year gain in July.As higher mortgage rates continue to derail home sales, Oxford Economics predicts, \"the news on housing is only going to get worse from here.'' America's factories are still expanding. But the outlook is dimming. A manufacturing index issued Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management, an organization of purchasing managers, showed that factories have been growing for 29 straight months. Still, the index fell in October to its lowest level since May 2020, when the economy was still struggling under the weight of COVID-forced business shutdowns. New orders, new export orders and hiring all contracted.Likewise, the government reported last week that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods (excluding the volatile transportation sector) fell 0.5 in September.That report \"does not bode well,'' wrote Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Factory-produced goods will likely be weakened by the higher dollar and stagnant economies overseas. Bostjancic warned that the U.S. economy will likely weaken in the October-December quarter and slide in recession in the first half of 2023. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, emerging from a private meeting last week with business executives at a massive foundry-turned-tech hub, smiled despite what he said was a difficult conversation about inflation, high energy prices, staffing shortages and rising crime. \"We had a very good discussion, even though it wasn't particularly uplifting, because the reality right now is concerning,\" Johnson said.As one of the nation's critical U.S. Senate races nears an end, Johnson has reason to feel confident.

And Johnson is hammering those themes in what amounts to his closing argument for voters to give him a third term over Democrat Mandela Barnes, the lieutenant governor.\"These people are fundamentally destroying this country,\" Johnson said of Barnes and Democrats at a campaign stop Monday. \"They have to be stopped. They need to be defeated. They need a real shellacking.\"Barnes has ratcheted up his own rhetoric in the closing days, saying Johnson has \"lied to our faces for 12 straight years\" and returned repeatedly to Johnson's downplaying of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his attempts to deliver a slate of fake electors to former Vice President Mike Pence.\"He's not just a danger to this state, he's a threat to the stability of this country,\" Barnes said Tuesday at a meeting of the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. \"That's who he is.\"The Wisconsin race is one of a handful that could be critical to which party controls the Senate. Polls have shown Johnson with an apparently increasing lead over Barnes, and national Republicans who abandoned his campaign six years ago are pouring money into the final days.The former plastics manufacturer rode the tea party wave in 2010 to win his first Senate race over Sen. Russ Feingold, then beat Feingold in a rematch six years later. Johnson has proven to be an elusive target for liberals even as he has drifted rightward since Donald Trump's election in 2016 and polls have shown Johnson's favorability rating to be upside down. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016, and lost it in 2020, by less than a point. Johnson won both of his elections by fewer than 5 points.Barnes, who is seeking to become Wisconsin's first Black senator, has sought to portray Johnson as out of touch with the cares of middle-class voters. He has reminded them of an investigation by ProPublica that found that provisions Johnson added to the 2017 tax bill delivered millions in tax savings to key donors including billionaire Diane Hendricks of Beloit-based ABC Supply. Hendricks developed the industrial park in Beloit where Johnson had his meeting. She has poured millions into his race, including 3.1 million a month before Election Day.Johnson hasn't shied away from his vote in support of the 2017 tax bill. He said a provision he pushed for cutting business taxes \"allows small businesses to compete with the big guys.\"Barnes, who paid no income taxes in 2018 and was on the state's Medicaid program, has contrasted his upbringing in Milwaukee by his schoolteacher mom and factory worker father with Johnson's wealth. He has also pointed out a generational divide; at 35, he's almost half the age of the 67-year-old Johnson.\"Ron Johnson does not truly represent who we are,\" Barnes said at the Madison rally with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a fellow millennial and former Democratic presidential candidate. \"People like Ron Johnson have had their day; it's our time now.\"Barnes, like Democrats all across the country, has also tried to make the race a referendum on abortion rights. Johnson is a longtime supporter of an abortion ban without exceptions, a position Barnes calls \"dangerous and out of touch.\" Johnson has tried to blunt the issue by saying he supported a state referendum to let voters decide, but he opposed an effort by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for such a vote.And Barnes has tried to present himself as a unifier, echoing themes of both President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama's campaigns, saying Tuesday that \"we've got to bring back decency to this state and to this country.\"Both Barnes and Johnson say the other has done little to help the state over their time in office.Barnes served four years in the Assembly as part of a Democratic minority that could do little against the Republican majority. As lieutenant governor, a job with almost no official duties, Barnes took up the issue of climate change and led a task force examining ways the state can address it. Johnson points to passage of his \"right-to-try bill,\" which allowed terminally ill patients to receive experimental drugs, as one of the ways he has delivered for Wisconsin. Johnson has said things politicians usually shy away from, including taking away guaranteed funding for Social Security and Medicare, saying that's the only way to save the popular entitlement programs. He contends voters will reward him for truth-telling.\"When I ran in 2010 I made two promises,\" Johnson said in Beloit. \"I'll always tell you the truth, and I'll never vote or conduct myself with my reelection in mind. I've honored those promises.\"A reporter pointed out that Johnson had also promised to only serve two terms.\"That was my intention,\" Johnson said. \"Things change.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, file)NEW YORK (AP) -- Victoria's Secret  Co. said Tuesday it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Adore Me Inc., a lingerie startup known for its wide array of sizes, for 400 million in cash.The move comes as Victoria's Secret aims to become more inclusive and diversify beyond its sexy image of thongs and other come-hither lingerie.The deal is expect to close by the end of January, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances. Victoria's Secret said it plans to finance the transaction at closing with cash on hand.Adore Me, founded in 2011, serves more than 1.2 million active customers and is powered by a proprietary technology platform that features \"Home Try-On\" and monthly subscription options.

All Rights Reserved.LONDON (AP) -- A Moscow court stripped an exiled climate and antiwar activist who once was known as Russia's \"lone climate striker\" of his Russian citizenship Monday, according to the activist and his lawyer.The court also revoked the citizenship of Arshak Makichyan's two brothers and his father, who remains in Russia, the activist and his lawyer said. Makichyan described the ruling that rendered the four men stateless as retaliation for his political activities. Makichyan, an ally of Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg now living in Berlin, made headlines in 2019 with a string of solo protests on Moscow's Pushkin Square that lasted for months. Last year, he tried to run for parliament and to help another opposition candidate with her campaign. In recent months, he repeatedly spoke out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The decision to strip Armenian-born Makichyan and his relatives of their Russian nationality followed a court ruling last week that they provided false information when applying for citizenship in 2004, when Makichyan was 10 years old. The activist's lawyer, Olga Podopelova, strongly denied that her client or his family sought to mislead Russian authorities. In a written statement, she said Russia was using earlier procedural mistakes as a pretext for stripping the four men of citizenship. In an interview with The Associated Press, Makichyan said he became aware of the case against him in May as he and his wife mulled whether to return to Russia amid the Kremlin's ongoing crackdown on antiwar and other dissenting voices.\"We were trying to decide what to do next and considering returning to Russia when I was notified that a civil case had been launched against me,\" Makichyan told the AP. Makichyan and his partner, fellow activist Polina Oleinikova, got married on February 24, the day Russian troops began invading Ukraine. The couple left for Germany four weeks into the war, following the Kremlin's brutal dispersal of protests. Makichyan is appealing for international help as he and his relatives continue to contest the citizenship case in Russian courts.\"I don't intend to ask for asylum (in Germany). I'm hoping for a reaction from European politicians, for their help in resolving this unprecedented situation,\" he said.The court verdict doesn't take effect until the appeal process concludes, so his father and brothers have not lost their right to remain in Russia, Makichyan said. His German visa is valid until the end of the year. In the meantime, several Russian businessmen have renounced their citizenship voluntarily.Russian business tycoon Oleg Tinkov said he decided to renounce his Russian nationality over the war in Ukraine, which he has regularly spoken out against.Tinkov, who has lived abroad in recent years and says he was forced to sell his business assets in Russia at a loss because of his anti-war position, announced the decision Monday on Instagram.\"I can't look at all this and be associated with Putin's fascism!\" the founder of the Tinkoff Bank said in a post that featured a photo of what appeared to be a document certifying his renunciation of Russian citizenship. The post has since disappeared from his account, which Tinkov blamed on the \"Kremlin's trolls\" in a new post Tuesday reiterating his decision. It wasn't immediately clear what other nationality he holds.British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that Nikolay Storonsky, co-founder of the financial technology company Revolut, also renounced his Russian citizenship. Storonsky holds a British passport, the newspaper said, and his father -- a director at Gazprom Promgaz, an arm of the state-controlled Russian energy giant -- was recently sanctioned.Earlier this month, billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner said on Twitter that he and his family gave up their Russian passports.Makichyan expressed doubts about the billionaires' motives. In a series of tweets published Tuesday morning, he appeared to highlight their privileged position compared to activists such as himself.\"Russian billionaires are refusing (their) Russian citizenship. I am fighting for it. We are different,\" Makichyan wrote. Associated Press writer Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)LIV Golf filed its application for world ranking points a month after it played its first event, and none was awarded for the inaugural season as the Official World Golf Ranking considers it.The effect of not earning ranking points -- except for two majors and a few European tour events -- is becoming clear with each week.LIV Golf signed 18 players who were among the top 50 going into 2022. With two months left in the year, now there are only 11. Of those players, nine were in the top 25 to start the year. Now there are three.Dustin Johnson was No. 13 when he signed. Now he is at No. 31, one spot behind Corey Conners.Nine players have fallen out of the top 100, a group that includes Phil Mickelson, Ian Poulter and Matthew Wolff.Still to be determined is how much the majors will rely on the world ranking as part of their criteria. But even if the majors left everything the way it was last year, 35 of the leading 48 players from LIV Golf would not be exempt for the Masters, U.S. Open or British Open next year. The PGA Championship bases a bulk of its field on \"special invitations,\" and those invitations tend to go to players in the top 100.Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Brooks Koepka and most likely Johnson would be the only ones assured of playing in all four majors. All have won majors from 2019 or onward, and those typically come with a five-year exemption to the other majors.Tiger Woods played to the crowd when he made a hole-in-one at the Greater Milwaukee Open in his professional debut in 1996. He tossed the ball into the crowd. It bounced off the hands of Bob Gustin's brother-in-law right into his lap.Even more fortuitous for Gustin was getting Woods to sign the Titleist Professional 90.Gustin has kept the ball in a glass case with all the tournament information on a gold plaque. And now it's going to auction.The \"1996 Tiger Woods Hole-in-One Golf Ball\" will be in Heritage Auctions' Fall Sports Catalog on Nov. 17-19. A full ticket from the tournament where Woods made his pro debut sold for 99,000 in February.Gustin said he would be splitting the proceed with David Beck, his brother-in-law.\"He's the one who shouted, 'Throw it over here!' He's the only who it deflected off of before it came to me,\" Gustin said. \"We both had a part in me ending up with this ball, so we'll both enjoy it after it goes to someone else.\"Woods had made only three aces on tour, all early in his career. He made his most famous hole-in-one on the 16th hole of the Phoenix Open the following year, and his third one at the Sprint International in 1998.Lydia Ko is making another coaching change, leaving Sean Foley after more than two years. Ko said the split was for \"logistical reasons.\"The split comes during one of Ko's most consistent seasons. She has risen to No. 3 in the world and leads the race for LPGA Player of the Year (by one point) and the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average.\"When I first met Sean, I was in a place where I didn't have a lot of confidence in myself and in my game,\" Ko wrote on Instagram. \"Over the past two years he has helped me evolve as a better player and person. Our time together was full of so much learning, laughter. Last month, we decided to go our own ways as a coach and player due to logistical reasons, but Sean will always be a close friend. Sean has been and will be a mentor to me.\"Jin Young Ko lost the No. 1 ranking this week to Atthaya Thitikul, largely due to an injured left wrist that kept her out for two months and led to her withdrawing when she returned two weeks ago at the BMW Ladies Championship in South Korea.Ko now has a chance to do something no one else has since the women's world ranking made its debut in 2006. No one has reached No. 1 five times.Ko, Sung Hyun Park and Inbee Park each have gone to No. 1 on four occasions. Ko is hopeful of returning for the final two LPGA events in Florida.She has been No. 1 for 156 weeks, two weeks short of the record set by Lorena Ochoa. Ochoa reached No. 1 only once and stayed there until her surprise retirement in 2010.Chase Koepka has played in Bangkok, Saudi Arabia and Miami in the past four months. Now he's headed for Morocco to play in the International Series event on the Asian Tour.Never mind that Koepka won more money on LIV Golf this year -- 4.3 million -- than the Asian Tour event offers in total prize money (1.5 million).Koepka is among six players who earned more in LIV Golf than the total prize find in Morocco this week. The others are James Piot, Turk Pettit, Wade Ormsby, Sihwan Kim and Phachara Khongwatmai.The Morocco field includes 15 players who have competed in at least one LIV Golf Invitational event this year, including Andy Ogletree. He played in the inaugural LIV event outside London, finished last and made 120,000.In the non-major division, Rory McIlroy winning the CJ Cup at Congaree and The Summit allowed him to join Tiger Woods as the only players in the past 20 years to twice defend a title on a different course.McIlroy also won the Canadian Open at Hamilton in 2019 and at St. George's in 2022 (two years were canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic). Woods won a World Golf Championship in Ireland (2002) and north of Atlanta (2003), and then Harding Park (2005), The Grove outside London (2006) and Doral (2007).Throw in the majors over the past 20 years and the list expands. Woods twice defended his PGA Championship title at different courses (Medinah-Valhalla in 1999-2000 and Medinah-Southern Hills in 2006-07) and the British Open (St. Andrews-Royal Liverpool in 2005-06). Brooks Koepka won the U.S. Open in consecutive years at Erin Hills and Shinnecock Hills and the PGA Championship at Bellerive and Bethpage Black).Chicago Golf Club, one of the founding clubs of the USGA, will host the U.S. Women's Open for the first time in 2033. ... Oliver Bekker has played 26 times on the European tour this year and earned 776,297 euros. He played one time at a LIV Golf Invitational and made 737,500. ... The Irish Open is moving to Sept. 7-10 next year, putting it two weeks after the FedEx Cup ends and two weeks before the Ryder Cup in Italy. ... One day after Tennessee Volunteers freshman Caleb Surratt was 21 shots worse (64-85), he was 20 shots better (85-65) at the Bermuda Championship. ... John Solheim has been selected to receive the PGA Distinguished Service Award. Solheim, the executive chairman of Ping and the son of founder Karsten Solheim, is to be honored Wednesday at the PGA of America's annual meeting in Phoenix. ...

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Liberty McCoy was out Saturday urging voters to pass a Nov. 8 ballot measure to limit rent increases in Pasadena because she's afraid she'll be priced out of the city where she grew up and where her aging parents live.The librarian and her husband, a freelance consultant, received notice of a 100 monthly rent increase last year and another for 150 this year, bringing the rent on their home outside Los Angeles to 2,350 a month. They can absorb the increases for now -- but not forever. \"A lot of times people are like, 'Well, just try and pick up and move to someplace cheaper,'\" the 44-year-old said. \"But I have a job locally, my family, my friends. It would be a big challenge to uproot my entire life chasing cheaper rent.\" With rental prices skyrocketing and affordable housing in short supply, inflation-weary tenants in cities and counties across the country are turning to the ballot box for relief. Supporters say rent control policies on the Nov. 8 ballot are the best short-term option to dampen rising rents and ensure vulnerable residents remain housed.Opponents, led by the real-estate industry, say rent control will lead to higher prices for tenants in housing not covered by rent caps, harm mom-and-pop landlords relying on rental income for retirement, and discourage the construction of badly needed affordable housing. They have spent heavily to stop ballot initiatives, even going to court to halt them.In Orange County, Florida, home to Disney World and other theme parks, voters will consider a ballot initiative to limit rent increases to the annual increase in the consumer price index. But a court ruling last week means that even if it passes, it could be nullified.Proponents in Orlando and other Orange County cities point to a population that has increased 25 since 2010 and rents that jumped 25 between 2020 and 2021 -- and experienced another double-digit increase this year. The housing shortage was magnified by Hurricane Ian, with an estimated 1,140 rental properties suffering 44.5 million in damage.\"I've had a lot of constituents reach out to me, and they are fearful of becoming homeless. They don't know what to do,\" said Orange County Commissioner Emily Bonilla, who authored the ballot initiative ordinance after hearing from tenants facing rent increases upwards of 100.Last year, voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, passed a ballot measure capping rents at 3 a year while residents across the river in Minneapolis backed a measure allowing the city council to enact a rent control ordinance. This summer, Kingston, New York, became the first upstate city to enact rent control. The measure means around 1,200 units -- buildings built before 1974 with six or more units -- must limit rents to a percentage set by a rent guidelines board.Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu was elected last year and made bringing back rent control to the city part of her campaign. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide.\"Rent stabilization can provide protections for everyone, but do so in a way that really targets benefits to low-income renters, renters of color, renters who are most desperately impacted by housing instability,\" said Tram Hoang, a housing policy expert who was involved in the St. Paul campaign.The fight over rent control has been most intense out West, where in 2019, lawmakers in California and Oregon approved statewide caps on annual rent increases. California's annual cap cannot exceed 10 and Oregon's is set at 7, plus the consumer price index. Both laws exempt new construction for 15 years, a compromise to encourage developers to keep building, and apply only to certain units. But that hasn't quelled tenant activism in California, where nearly half the state's 40 million residents are renters. Advocates say the statewide law -- which expires in 2030 -- does not go far enough. Voters in the San Francisco suburb of Richmond and Southern California beachside city of Santa Monica will consider measures to further tighten existing rent caps to a maximum of 3. In the city of Pasadena -- home to the annual Rose Parade and Rose Bowl college football game -- voters will consider a measure to create a rent oversight board and limit rent increases to 75 of the consumer price index, which supporters say translates to 2 to 3 a year. Rent stabilization advocates failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the 2018 ballot, and they thought it would be hard this time around because the state had enacted protections. But campaign field director Bee Rooney said tenants financially wrecked by the pandemic were eager to back the initiative. \"Any amount when you're not expecting it is a lot,\" Rooney said. \"Some people, their rent doubled or went up by 50.\"Pasadena retiree Paulette Brown received the state-allowed increase of 10 in July, bringing the rent on her two-bedroom apartment to 1,175 a month. Budgeting will be tighter. \"I really can't afford any mishaps, because I'm not able to save anything,\" said the 64-year-old Brown, who lives with her daughter and grandson. Opponents of the measure, which include the national and state realtors associations, say curtailing rent increases to a fraction of inflation will result in property owners taking rentals off the market and doing minimal maintenance. \"What's being proposed here is draconian and for the most part landlords who have good tenants aren't trying to get rid of them,\" said Paul Little, president and CEO of the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce. Michael Wilkerson, senior economist at Portland, Oregon-based ECONorthwest, describes both the California and Oregon state laws as \"anti-price gouging\" measures aimed at protecting the most vulnerable tenants from exorbitant increases, while encouraging new housing development. Rent-control policies have been around for decades, put in place after World War II in New York City and elsewhere to combat rising housing prices and again in the 1970s in the Northeast and California. However, the real-estate industry has since succeeded in passing state laws that made it difficult, if not impossible, for many local municipalities to cap rents.The data on rent control has been mixed. The policy, according to an Urban Institute report, was found to have reduced rent on covered units in Cambridge, Massachusetts, San Francisco and New York but resulted in no significant decreases in New Jersey cities. Some studies, however, have shown that rent control can reduce the number of housing units available and discourage landlords from maintaining them.Opponents also say rent regulation can scare off developers. St. Paul's original ordinance, for example, applied to almost all housing and mandated landlords stick to the 3 cap even with new tenants. Within weeks, council members were hearing from developers who blamed the new law for scuttling housing projects because they lost funding. Building permits issued for new housing through August plummeted 31 from the four-year average. In response, the city council approved amendments in September to exempt low-income housing as well as new construction for 20 years. It also allows landlords to raise rents 8 plus the consumer price index after a tenant moves out.Orange County's ballot measure is up in the air after an appeals court rejected the proposal last week and suggested it won't be certified even if voters approve it.The court, which acknowledged the state law \"set an extremely high bar\" for local governments to pass rent control ordinances, said a consultant hired by the county didn't identify a housing emergency -- a requirement under a 1977 state law preempting local rent control. The county plans to file a motion for a rehearing and with ballots already out, the Orange County Supervisor of Elections said it has no plans to issue new ones. Supporters of the measure said they will keep campaigning.For tenants like Jessy Correa, the setback means she faces a 20 rent increase on her three-bedroom apartment in Orlando come January. The 44-year-old mother of six is already struggling to afford the current rent of 2,300. A recruiter at a faith-based nonprofit, she was hoping the ballot initiative would \"bring stability, give us a moment to breathe.\" Instead, she is now forced to make difficult choices, like getting another job.\"Where is the American dream of being able to live, to enjoy?\" she asked tearfully after learning of the court ruling. \"What are we doing? It's frustrating.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history could soar to the largest ever if no one wins the top prize in Wednesday, Nov. 2, Powerball drawing. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history could soar to the largest ever if no one wins the top prize in Wednesday night's Powerball drawing.The jackpot climbed to 1.2 billion after no one matched all six numbers to win the jackpot. That makes 38 consecutive draws without a jackpot winner since the last person won the big prize on Aug. 3.The jackpot grows after every drawing without a winner and now is approaching the record of 1.586 billion won by three Powerball players in 2016. The second- and third-largest prizes were hit by players of the Mega Millions lottery game.\"I think it would be close to being a record if not a record,\" said Drew Svitko, the Pennsylvania Lottery's executive director. \"The record of 1.586 billion that we had back in 2016 is within reach, but it really depends on a couple factors.\"The first factor is the number of tickets sold, and they are flying out of lottery machines throughout the country.For the Monday night drawing, there were 131.6 million Powerball plays sold, said Anna Domoto, a spokeswoman for the Multi-State Lottery Association, which oversees the game. That amounted to 36.3 of all possible number combinations being covered, as millions of players picked the same numbers.That's a lot, but considering the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, that means about 186 million number combinations weren't covered, which is why no one won the grand prize.Although the focus of the game is on the 1.2 billion prize, that is the amount for an annuity, doled out over 29 annual payments. Nearly all winners choose a cash prize, which would be 596.7 million.Still, the advertised prize is based on the annuity, and that's where the second factor in determining the jackpot comes in as higher interest rates cause annuities to grow more quickly. Put another way, the 596.7 million in cash is funneled into investments that will eventually pay out 1.2 billion, and those investments grow faster as interest rates rise.\"We use investments to fund the annuity to pay that prize, so the investments rely on interest and the degree to which interest rates effect the value of those investments also effect that jackpot,\" Svitko said.Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Wayne Wegener confirmed that officers found a deceased man after responding to a welfare check on Monday afternoon, at a home near Vikings headquarters where Adam Zimmer was living. There was nothing suspicious about the death, Wegener said, and the investigation was turned over to the medical examiner for determination of cause.\"We are heartbroken to hear about the passing of Adam Zimmer. Adam was a kind, respectful man, and over his years in Minnesota, it was evident he cared tremendously about his family, his players, his fellow coaches and the Vikings front office staff. Our thoughts are with Mike, Corri, Marki and the entire Zimmer family,\" Vikings ownership said in a statement.Adam Zimmer broke into the NFL in 2006 with the New Orleans Saints. He was hired by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2010 as an assistant linebackers coach and spent the 2013 season with the Bengals as an assistant defensive backs coach in Mike Zimmer's final season there as defensive coordinator. \"Our organization has had the privilege of knowing and working with the Zimmer family for 15 years. We have the highest regard for Mike and Adam, and we are incredibly saddened by this tragic news,\" Bengals owner Mike Brown said in a statement. \"Mike and Adam were more than just coaches for us -- they were friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Zimmer family.\"When the Vikings hired Mike Zimmer in 2014, he brought his son with him to coach linebackers. Adam Zimmer was promoted to co-defensive coordinator with Andre Patterson in 2020.\"Disregard the familial connection. It's really just about him being a good coach,\" former Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"It wouldn't have mattered who the head coach was. Adam was a good coach no matter what.\"Though he was older than Adam Zimmer, Greenway quickly developed a trust in his new position coach while trying to learn a new defense in his ninth NFL season.\"He was respectful of the game and the career that I had before that he got there,\" Greenway said. \"He was always working with you and not coaching at you, always trying to make the individual better and the team better. He was really smart when it came to the scheme, but more importantly he was a great person who always cared about you as a person.\" Mike Zimmer's wife, Adam Zimmer's mother, Vikki Zimmer, died unexpectedly at age 50 in 2009. That was Adam Zimmer's last year with the Saints, when they went on to win the Super Bowl.\"We had fond memories of Adam from the four years he spent in our organization as an assistant coach,\" the Saints said in a statement. \"Adam was knowledgeable, hard working, well-liked by everyone he came into contact with, and enthusiastic. During his time with the Saints, he quickly developed into an excellent coach.\"Corri Zimmer White said in her Instagram post that Adam Zimmer told her \"countless times\" how he loved watching her be a mother to his 1-year-old twin nephews.\"My brother was one of my best friends, especially after my mom died, we became so close. He was always there for me and always the first to show up and volunteer at my foundation events,\" she said. \"I never even had to ask.\"Early in the pandemic, when NFL facilities shut down and coaches conducted offseason work remotely, Adam Zimmer and his other sister, Marki Zimmer, sequestered with his father at his 160-acre ranch in Kentucky. Adam Zimmer provided on-site tech support for Mike Zimmer's internet connection and video conference trouble, and the two of them took advantage of the proximity to fine-tune the team's defensive scheme. Adam Zimmer manned the meat smoker for evening meals.\"If I can't get it figured out, I can text him and say, 'Come up here and fix this,'\" Mike Zimmer said in May 2020. \"At night, after dinner or something, we'll sit down and have some crazy idea and we'll say, 'OK, we can talk about it tomorrow with the rest of the defensive coaches.\"AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man's storage unit on Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County.The defendant's daughter reported her boyfriend missing on Oct. 28, telling police he hadn't been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant on Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor.The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff's office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he'd already dug a hole.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)NEW YORK (AP) -- Elon Musk didn't let the responsibilities of becoming CEO at a third major company curb his Halloween spirit this year. Fresh off of a 44 billion deal to buy Twitter, Musk showed up on a red carpet in New York City in what appeared to be a \"Devil's Champion\" costume alongside his mother, Maye Musk. Musk on Monday evening attended model Heidi Klum's Halloween bash on Manhattan's Lower East Side.AbracadabraNYC, a New York store that features the costume online, shows a list price of 7,500 for the \"armored\" red and black outfit. The world's richest man and CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and now Twitter, has been tied up in an acrimonious legal fight after attempting to back out of an agreement to acquire the social media platform. Musk has promised big changes at the social media company, including the possibility of charging verified Twitter users a monthly fee.

An AP survey shows the majority of candidates running this year for the state posts that oversee elections oppose the idea of hand counting ballots, a laborious and error-prone process that has gained favor among Republicans who have been inundated with unfounded voting machine conspiracy theories. (AP Photo/Jim Rassol, File)The vast majority of candidates running to become their states' chief election officers oppose hand counting ballots, a laborious and error-prone process that has gained favor among some Republicans embracing conspiracy theories about voting machines.An Associated Press survey of major-party secretary of state candidates in the 24 states found broad skepticism about hand counting among election professionals of all ideological stripes. Of 23 Republicans who responded to the survey, 13 clearly said they opposed implementing a statewide hand count of ballots instead of a machine count. GOP candidates in Arizona and New Mexico have previously endorsed the idea of a hand count. But others cautioned it was a dangerous road to follow. \"Hand counting ballots is a process that requires time, manpower, and is prone to inaccuracies,\" Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican who is seeking reelection this year, wrote in response to the AP survey.The desire to hand count ballots stems from conspiracy theories spread by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the electronic machines that tabulated the results of the 2020 presidential election were rigged. Now some Republicans inspired by his election lies seek to expand or require hand counting of all ballots.Counting by hand takes longer, requires large groups of people to examine ballots, and has been found by multiple studies to be less reliable than using voting machines.\"The reason the U.S. moved to counting machines is due to both human error and fraud with hand counts, so we looked for a better way to count the vote,\" said Kim Crockett, the Republican nominee for secretary of state in Minnesota, in an email. \"The error rate for hand counts is higher than the error rate for ballot counters in most cases.\"Crockett, who has called the 2020 election \"rigged\" and echoed some of Trump's other election falsehoods, also stressed that she thinks her state's voting machines still need further inspection.The process came under scrutiny last week when rural Nye County in Nevada embarked on an unprecedented full hand count of this year's midterm votes, starting with mailed ballots and those cast early in-person. The process was painstakingly slow until it was halted by the state's supreme court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.While the AP survey found most candidates strongly favor machine tabulators, two GOP secretary of state candidates in politically pivotal states -- Arizona and New Mexico -- want to shift to the unreliable method of counting ballots. A third in yet another swing state, Nevada, has backed Nye County's effort and voiced support for making that sort of procedure standard statewide.In Arizona, Republican State Rep. Mark Finchem, who is running for secretary of state, joined his party's nominee for governor, Kari Lake, in filing a lawsuit seeking to outlaw the use of any machine to record or tabulate votes. The case was dismissed by a judge who levied sanctions against the Republicans.In New Mexico, GOP secretary of state nominee Audrey Trujillo has said she wants widespread hand counting of votes.\"Hand count my ballot. We already have paper ballots,\" she said in an interview on the video platform Rumble. \"If we had that, I guarantee you tons more people would go out and vote.\"Neither Finchem nor Trujillo responded to the AP's survey.Nevada's Republican secretary of state candidate has offered conflicting responses. A campaign spokesman for Republican nominee Jim Marchant told the AP that Marchant would be fine with a machine count as long as there also are paper ballots, which are universally used in Nevada. But the prior month, Marchant told the AP in a separate interview, \"My goal is to go to a hand count paper ballot system.\"Nevada's current secretary of state, Republican Barbara Cegavske, told interim Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf to halt the hand count of early arriving mailed ballots and early in-person votes until after polls close Nov. 8 following a ruling late last week from the state's high court. The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had sought to halt the hand count over concerns that observers could hear the results as they were announced, risking a potential public leak of early returns.The nascent hand-count had been riddled with problems on its first day, with repeated delays and errors among the volunteer staff of 12 teams of five split into two different shifts. They got through 900 of 1,950 ballots on the first day, with one volunteer lamenting the slow pace: \"I can't believe it's two hours to get through 25.\"An AP reporter observed two teams of five taking as long as three hours to count 50 ballots. When teams realized they had mismatched tallies for certain candidates, they would stop and recount the ballots for those candidates again. That effort followed a hand count in another rural Nevada county, Esmeralda, where election workers in June spent more than seven hours hand-tallying the 317 primary ballots.Kampf said the teams improved during the second day.Eleven candidates, mostly Republicans, did not respond to the AP's survey, including one of the most prominent election conspiracy theorists running for the position -- Republican Kristina Karamo in Michigan, a community college instructor who has spread the lie that voting machines in 2020 were rigged.\"Election deniers are using the language of election integrity to dismantle the actual infrastructure of election integrity,\" said David Becker, the co-author of \"The Big Truth,\" a book about the risks of Trump's voting lies, and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation  Research. \"If you want inaccurate results that take a really long time and cost a lot, then hand counting is your solution.\"Voting machines are routinely checked before and after voting to make sure they count accurately. The post-election test usually involves pulling a sample of random ballots and counting them by hand to see if the automated tally differs.But repeated studies -- in voting and other fields such as banking and retail -- have shown that people make far more errors counting than do machines, especially when reaching larger and larger numbers. They're also vastly slower.Jennifer Morrell, a former local election official in Colorado and Utah, noted that hand counts are enormously labor-intensive. The election consulting firm where she works estimated that in a typical-sized jurisdiction of 270,000 voters, it would take 1,300 people to count the ballots within seven days.That's because the typical ballot has dozens of races on it, which machines tabulate automatically but humans would have to count line by line, page by page.\"Voting equipment is uniform and efficient in a way that humans will never be,\" Morrell said.Associated Press statehouse reporters from around the U.S. contributed to this report.Follow AP's coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsCheck out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A former Connecticut state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than 1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors.Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa's wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial.At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds -- some of which he spent at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut.DiMassa, 31, resigned from both positions after his arrest last year.No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges he pleaded guilty to is 41 to 51 months. He also will have to pay back the city for the amount of money he stole.DiMassa, who remains free on a 250,000 bond, didn't answer questions as he left the courthouse Tuesday. During the hearing, he said \"Guilty\" one time when asked how he was pleading to the three charges, and said \"Yes, your honor\" and \"No, your honor\" while answering a series of questions from Judge Omar Williams.After the hearing, his lawyer, John Gulash Jr., declined to answer questions about why DiMassa pleaded guilty, why he stole the money and whether he will be apologizing, saying those answers will come at sentencing.\"As you heard in court, he readily admitted his wrongdoing and entered pleas to the appropriate charges,\" Gulash said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Ray Miller said DiMassa was involved in three separate conspiracies that defrauded West Haven out of 1.2 million through bogus invoices for coronavirus-related services never performed.DiMassa and a business partner, John Bernardo, also a former West Haven city employee, pilfered nearly 637,000, Miller said. They formed a company, Compass Investment Group LLC, and billed the city for legal, lobbying and consulting services never rendered.Bernardo also pleaded guilty to wire fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced later this month.In a second scheme, DiMassa and another business owner, John Trasacco, conspired to submit fraudulent invoices from Trasacco's companies to the city, netting nearly 432,000, Miller said.Trasacco has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges and is slated to go on trial later this month.The final conspiracy involved DiMassa and his wife, Lauren DiMassa, and the theft of nearly 148,000. Miller said. The couple submitted phony requests for payments related to a youth violence prevention program and its COVID-19-related expenses, and Lauren DiMassa received checks from the city, according to a federal grand jury indictment.Lauren DiMassa pleaded guilty in July to wire fraud conspiracy and her sentencing is set for January.The criminal cases brought scrutiny on West Haven officials and how the city spent more than 1 million it received in federal COVID-19 relief funds. An audit released in April indicated about 80 of the expenditures should not have been allowed.In May, Gov. Ned Lamont approved a recommendation by a state board to place West Haven's finances under greater state oversight. The city had previously been placed under state oversight because of budget deficit problems.West Haven Mayor Nancy Rossi, who had authorized Michael DiMassa to approve spending the coronavirus aid, has faced criticism from local residents, including calls to resign, because of the scandal.\"Since these incidents happened, there are many more additional internal controls in place,\" she said in a statement Tuesday. \"Also there have been many changes in personnel in Finance and other departments. West Haven is trying to put this behind us and move forward.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Even before Republican legislators this summer made Indiana the first state to pass an abortion ban since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats started urging angry voters to take their revenge at the ballot box. Indiana Democrats haven't let up on that push in the final days of this year's elections, although a limited number of competitive races on the Nov. 8 ballot for the currently Republican-dominated Legislature leave them with slim chances of being able to do much about abortion access that is also being debated during campaigns across the country. (AP Photo/Tom Davies)INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Even before Republican legislators this summer made Indiana the first state to pass an abortion ban since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Democrats started urging angry voters to take their revenge at the ballot box.Indiana Democrats haven't let up on that push in the final days of this year's elections, although a limited number of competitive races on the Nov. 8 ballot for the currently Republican-dominated Legislature leave them with slim chances of being able to do much about abortion access that is also being debated during campaigns across the country.Indiana Republicans, meanwhile, argue that voters are more worried about other issues such as inflation and crime -- concerns widely believed to favor the GOP.Democratic candidate Joey Mayer said the abortion ban has remained a top issue as she's talked with voters in a northern Indianapolis suburban district where she's challenging a four-term Republican House member who voted in favor of the ban when it passed in August.\"Many people that I have met through door-knocking that identify as a Libertarian or a lifelong Republican have said, 'I'm done, I'm done. This is ridiculous overreach,'\" Mayer said.The state Supreme Court has allowed abortions to continue in Indiana while it considers a lawsuit from abortion clinic operators arguing that the ban violates the state constitution.Mayer, a business consultant from Westfield, said the blocking of the abortion ban only slowed down talk about it among voters for a couple days.\"Then people were like, 'This doesn't fix the problem' and it seemed like everybody started to get spun up again,\" Mayer said.Republicans go into the election with a 71-29 Indiana House majority and a 39-11 state Senate advantage, giving them supermajorities in both chambers that allow them to take action even without any Democrats present.Republicans used those commanding margins to boost their legislative campaign funds to about 8 million for the year through the end of September -- about four times what Democrats raised, according to state campaign reports. GOP lawmakers also controlled last year's redistricting process that produced new legislative district maps that political analysts found locked in a partisan advantage for the next decade.In order to pick up the five House seats needed to break the two-thirds supermajority, Democrats such as Mayer will have to capture Republican-held seats in suburban Indianapolis and hold onto GOP-targeted seats in cities such as Anderson and Jeffersonville.Current Republican lawmakers largely held off numerous hard-right challengers in the May primary who argued that the Legislature had not been aggressive enough in attempting to ban abortion. The law that ultimately passed during a special session over the summer includes exceptions allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest and to protect the life and physical health of the mother -- exceptions that were opposed by many anti-abortion activists as making the ban too lax.Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said he believed his party would retain the supermajority as GOP candidates have focused on talking about issues such as the economy, education and crime.\"It's hard to talk about how Democratic leadership is doing things positively across the country,\" Huston said. \"So, you have to pick one thing and they decided the one thing they wanted to pick. I think we've got a much broader and better story to tell.\"Many voters won't have a chance of voting Democratic for the Legislature as the party doesn't have candidates on the ballot for 33 of the 100 House seats and eight of the 25 Senate seats up for election. Republicans aren't running in 14 House races while all Senate districts have GOP candidates.The July 15 deadline for parties to fill ballot vacancies passed a couple weeks after the Supreme Court's abortion ruling and before the Legislature's special session began.Republican state Sen. Vaneta Becker of Evansville, who joined Democrats in opposing the abortion ban, said many women have been angry about the law and Democrats missed an opportunity by not having more candidates. Time also hasn't been on the side of those campaigning as abortion-rights supporters, said Becker, a 41-year member of the Legislature.\"I think if the election had been held in September they would have done a lot better,\" Becker said. \"I think now it's kind of fatigued.\"Democratic candidate Katherine Rybak said issues such as rising utility costs were on her mind when she decided last year to challenge Republican Rep. Wendy McNamara in a GOP-leaning district that covers part of Evansville and extends into rural Posey County in southwestern Indiana.The abortion issue was pushed to the forefront in that race as Huston picked McNamara to sponsor the abortion ban bill this summer and Cheryl Batteiger-Smith, a former Posey County Republican vice chair, joined the ballot as an independent calling for a tighter abortion ban without exceptions.Rybak, a semi-retired lawyer, said she believed that victories by candidates such as herself who support abortion rights would send a strong message to the Legislature.\"If I can pull this out, it will show that there is a groundswell of support for women and women's rights, and I think it may moderate the Republican Legislature,\" Rybak said. \"That's all we can hope at this point. I think it does show that maybe a safe seat isn't a safe seat.\"Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

The child's mother, Chioma Rowland, was also away, according to Lagos police spokesman Ben Hundeyin.Authorities are interviewing eight of the pop star's employees who were at the Lagos residence, he added.Neither parent has spoken publicly about their son's death, just two weeks after Ifeanyi's third birthday.The global award-winning musician got engaged to Rowland, a popular chef, in 2019. The couple had said recently that they plan to wed next year.Lagos Gov, Babajide Sanwo-Olu mourned Ifeanyi's death, tweeting that \"death leaves a heartache no words can heal.\"Peter Obi, one of the leading contenders in Nigeria's presidential election next year said he cannot \"begin to imagine the pains\" both parents are going through.\"No parents deserve what they are going through right now,\" Nigerian pop star Peter Okoye said of Davido and Rowland in an Instagram post.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr)New Orleans Saints head coach Dennis Allen looks up at a video replay during the second half of an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals in New Orleans, Sunday, Oct. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans coach Mike Vrabel offered handshakes and high-fives to his players as they exited Nissan Stadium following a victory two weeks ago. When he saw center Ben Jones limping up the ramp, Vrabel made a beeline for the veteran and grabbed him for an emotional bear hug.\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Vrabel said to Jones.Not as a player or a coach.Vrabel played 14 seasons as an NFL linebacker -- a career that included three Super Bowl titles with New England -- and has a level of experience that's hard to match for players and even rarer for coaches. So he had a genuine appreciation for what Jones sacrificed by playing through a knee injury and helping the Titans beat rival Indianapolis 19-10 on Oct. 23.\"This is an emotional game, and these guys put a lot into it,\" Vrabel said.Vrabel knows that as well as anyone. He's one of 10 current head coaches with NFL playing experience, some with considerably more than others.The list includes four in their second head coaching stints -- Dennis Allen (New Orleans), Todd Bowles (Tampa Bay), Doug Pederson (Jacksonville) and Ron Rivera (Washington) -- as well as second-year Detroit coach Dan Campbell and first-year Minnesota coach Kevin O'Connell, who has the Vikings (6-1) atop the NFC North. There's also Indianapolis' Frank Reich and two guys who, like Allen, barely had cups of coffee in the league: Arizona's Kliff Kingsbury and Cincinnati's Zac Taylor.Only Pederson and Campbell, who are a combined 0-10 in one-score games, have fewer than three wins as the league nears its halfway point.Although there's a rich tradition of NFL players becoming successful NFL coaches -- Mike Ditka, Jim Harbaugh, Marty Schottenheimer, Don Shula and Dan Reeves, to name a few -- there seems to be no direct correlation between the two.You don't have to have played a down in the NFL to be a great coach (see Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown, Bill Walsh, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Belichick). But there's no doubt it helps having NFL experience, whether it's organizing practices, managing egos or getting -- and keeping -- a locker room filled with millionaires on the same page.Coaches who played at football's highest level often share their experiences in hopes of imparting wisdom on young guys and connecting with veterans on a deeper, maybe more meaningful, level.\"It's easier to get behind a guy who's been there, who has the blueprint,\" Jaguars running back Travis Etienne said.Etienne had a front-row seat for Urban Meyer's debacle in Jacksonville in 2021. Jaguars owner Shad Khan hired Meyer out of the television booth in hopes that the three-time collegiate national champion would find raise the ultimate trophy on football's biggest stage. Meyer failed miserably, getting fired with cause after 11 games and countless missteps.Khan hired Pederson to replace Meyer, a 180-degree turn in terms of NFL experience. No one would be surprised to see Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper do something similar after firing former Baylor and Temple coach Matt Rhule five games into his third season.Rhule went 11-27 with the Panthers and became the latest college coach to fail while trying to transition to the big league. Given the tenures of Meyer and Rhule, it could at least provide pause for another NFL team considering the college route.It's hard to go wrong -- on paper, anyway -- with giving a former NFL player a chance. While teams might not find another Chuck Noll or Tony Dungy, they seemingly have better odds of landing the next Jack Del Rio or Jeff Fisher than Mike Singletary or Mike Munchak.The Jaguars are counting on the player-turned-coach formula to work. Pederson was an NFL backup quarterback for 14 seasons before working his way to the top spot in Philadelphia and leading the Eagles to a championship following the 2017 season.He's already been praised for bringing a new level of credibility to one of the worst franchises in the league the past two decades. Jacksonville (2-6), which lost 19 games by double digits over the past two seasons, has had a chance down the stretch in every game this year despite being 0-6 in one-score games.\"It's big when you know your coach has been there, he's been in your shoes, he's played at this level,\" Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. \"He handles things the right way.\"The adrenaline-pumping Campbell became somewhat of a cult hero for how he handled himself and his Lions on HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" in August and September. The former long-haired tight end, who played 11 NFL seasons, stole the season with his viral video clips.\"It doesn't matter if you have one (butt)cheek and three toes, I will beat your (butt),\" Campbell said in one team meeting.Campbell and Pederson built their staffs almost exclusively with former NFL players. Staff sizes have increased in recent years and assistant salaries continue to rise, enticing ex-NFLers, even some who are financially set for life, to return to the league in different, less glamorous, roles.Pederson's staff includes longtime NFL players Brentson Buckner, Mike Caldwell, Bernie Parmalee and Deshea Townsend. Campbell has Aaron Glenn, Mark Brunell, Duce Staley, Hank Fraley and Antwaan Randle El on the payroll.\"I just went into this thing literally saying, 'Where do I find the best guys? How do I find the best guys? Who are the best guys?'\" Campbell said. \"I swore I was never going to hire the coach first and the person second. I hired the person first and the coach second.\"Any of them could emerge as head coaching candidates. After all, it's typically easier to sell name recognition to a desperate fan base than play-calling acumen.That worked for Vrabel, 47, who took over at Tennessee in 2018 and has won the AFC South the past two years. The way he reacted to Jones' performance last month was the norm for a guy who's spent nearly half his life as part of the NFL and has set the bar relatively high for any future players turned coaches.\"I try not to be fake,\" Vrabel said. \"I try to be as real and as honest as I can.\"AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

McIngvale has wagered a total of 10 million with numerous sports books on an Astros victory.(AP Photo/Wayne Parry)ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A prolific Texas gambler with a knack for attention-getting bets stands to win nearly 75 million if the Houston Astros win the World Series, including what sportsbooks say would be the largest payout on a single legal sports bet in U.S. history.Jim \"Mattress Mack\" McIngvale of Houston has wagered a total of 10 million with numerous sportsbooks on an Astros victory.His bets include a 3 million wager made back in May with Caesars Sportsbook at 10-to-1 odds. It would pay him 30 million, which Brad Harwood, a spokesperson for the sportsbook, said would be the largest payout on a single legal sports bet in U.S. history.\"I have no fear in me,\" McIngvale said Tuesday, while giving away mattresses in Atlantic City to military personnel, veterans and first responders at Harrah's casino. \"I have a high tolerance for risk. If I lose, there's always another day.\"McIngvale has a long history of large bets on the World Series, Super Bowl and NCAA Final Four tournament. He links the bets to try to cover the cost of promotions at his mattress store in Houston; if the Astros win this year, customers who bought high-end mattresses will get their money back.In addition to his 3 million bet with Caesars, McIngvale bet 2 million with BetMGM; 2 million with Barstool Sports; and 1 million each with Wynn, Unibet and Betfred.Even if the Philadelphia Phillies prevail, McIngvale figures he'll still come out 500,000 to 1 million ahead after paying out customer refunds.He figures he's up \"probably a couple million net\" in the six or so years he has been making large bets on sports championships.But it doesn't always work out for him. He lost nearly 10 million on the most recent Super Bowl, backing the Cincinnati Bengals over the eventual champion Los Angeles Rams.He also whiffed on an Astros World Series bet last year, on Alabama in the national college championship game, as well as on NFL futures bets on the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans.The best-of-seven World Series was tied at a game apiece heading into Tuesday night's Game 3 in Philadelphia.Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at twitter.com/WayneParryACCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Mark Kelly and Libertarian candidate Marc Victor in Phoenix, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)PHOENIX (AP) -- The Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate from Arizona, Marc Victor, dropped out of the race Tuesday and urged his supporters to vote for Republican Blake Masters.Victor's endorsement a week before the midterm elections could help Masters further narrow the gap with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country. The endorsement came after overtures to Victor from Masters campaign aides and after Masters persuaded Victor in a Zoom conversation to back him. Victor posted video of their 25-minute discussion on his website.\"While we don't see eye to eye on everything I feel very confident after that conversation that Blake Masters is going to do everything he possibly can to further the interests of the Live and Let Live Global Peace Movement,\" Victor said in a video, referring to the organization he founded to advance his libertarian worldview. The race is one of a handful that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. The chamber is now divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tiebreaking votes. Some Republicans had worried that Victor would act as a spoiler, drawing votes from right-leaning voters who might have supported Masters in a head-to-head matchup against Kelly. The impact will be blunted, however, because the decision comes so close to the election that Victor's name will still appear on all ballots. More than 500,000 people had already voted by Oct. 25 and millions more had mail ballots in hand. Four years ago, a Green Party candidate dropped out of the Senate race days before the election amid fears among Democrats that she would be a spoiler. She still garnered 2.4 of the vote, and Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema still won the race.Victor is a defense attorney and longtime advocate for libertarian ideas. He was critical of both Masters and Kelly during the race's only televised debate. He has also said he's considering changing his party affiliation to Republican to run against Sinema. \"This is another major boost of momentum as we consolidate our support against the extreme and radical policies of Mark Kelly and Joe Biden,\" Masters said in a statement.Kelly shrugged off the significance, telling reporters during a campaign stop at Arizona State University that \"this race has always been between me and Blake Masters.\"Masters, 36 was a strident libertarian as a high school and college student, espousing his limited-government views in online posts that sparked controversies during the GOP primary. As a candidate, he's described himself as an \"America First conservative.\" He told NBC News in July that his libertarian beliefs were \"kind of childish\" and that he's become a conservative as he's grown up.Masters has been reaching out to libertarians during the closing days of the campaign as he looks to shore up his support among voters who lean to the right. He appeared on former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul's podcast last week and touted Paul's endorsement on social media, posting a 12-year-old picture of himself with Paul, who built a following among young libertarians during his campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012. Kelly's victory in a 2020 special election was powered by support from 61 of independents and 12 of Republicans, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of 3,772 voters in Arizona.Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

(Owen Humphreys/PA via AP)GENEVA (AP) -- FIFA's top doctor highlighted brain injuries in soccer as his top priority Tuesday ahead of a World Cup where teams can use an extra substitute if a player has a suspected concussion.\"I joined FIFA to try and make a little bit of a difference and brain injuries is top of my list. That is the one we can focus on,\" said Andrew Massey, who joined the world governing body as its medical director in 2020 after being team doctor at Liverpool. \"What we do at the World Cup will be evidenced at grass roots football.\" The tournament in Qatar will be the first World Cup where teams can make an additional permanent substitution in a game for a suspected concussion, on top of the five that can be used in the regulation 90 minutes.In the final of the 2014 World Cup, Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer stayed on the field for 14 first-half minutes after taking a heavy blow to the face when colliding with an Argentina opponent. He was replaced only after slumping to the ground.Soccer's often inconsistent attitude to head injuries was shown Saturday in the English Premier League. Aston Villa's Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez continued playing for several minutes against Newcastle despite looking groggy after colliding with a teammate. FIFAs law-making panel, known as IFAB, has specially allowed concussion subs at the World Cup as it continues trials that run through August next year with about 140 competitions globally.Massey said FIFA's strategy was to \"suspect and protect,\" aiming to avoid having injured players staying on the field until the severity of a head injury becomes clearer.\"We don't want to leave a team numerically disadvantaged or tactically disadvantaged,\" he told FIFA's in-house \"Living Football\" show.In Qatar, teams' medical staff will have tablets to see video replays quickly and get input from concussion spotters in the stands.\"Everything FIFA does is to support the team doctors\" who make the final decision if a player can continue playing or must be replaced, Massey said.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Martinez stopped playing soccer to become the first woman to play college football amongst men in Mexico's top amateur division. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano)MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Andrea Martinez didn't quite realize what she was getting herself into when she tried out to kick extra points for a Mexican college football team.She thought maybe it was a position on a women's team, or at least there would be other women on the roster. But when she won the spot, Martinez was told she would become the first woman to play college football amongst men in the country's top amateur division.\"At first one did not dimension it well because I did not even fully understand that I was going to be the first woman,\" Martinez admitted in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I thought there were more girls or that there was even going to be a women's team.\"Martinez, a law student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), had played soccer since she was 12 years old. She tried out to play professionally in the Liga Femenil MX, but didn't make the cut.She continued playing soccer at her school until a few months ago, when Pumas CU, the UNAM football team, decided to hold tryouts for a place-kicker.\"The decision I made was to try a new sport. Nothing else, just to venture out and see what it was all about,\" Martinez said. \"I was very happy when I heard the news that I had been the girl selected.\"Martinez, 21, said before playing football she barely watched NFL games, but it helped that her brother was a fan of the sport.She's among many Mexicans trading \"futbol\" for football, as the American sport continues to gain interest in the country. According to the NFL office in Mexico, the sport has some 48 million fans in the country.In the U.S., there are several women who have played as a place-kicker on male teams. Liz Heaston was the first to do it in 1997 with the Willamette Bearcats in the NAIA. Ashley Martin was the first one to score in an NCAA Division 1 game in 2001, playing for Jacksonville State.Martinez has her own locker room, but she performs the rest of the activities with the men on the team.\"Coexistence is the same as with girls. But the way we live together, the way we talk to each other, the way we support each other, the jokes we make, it's the same,\" Martinez said. \"I get along very well, I have gotten to know them, not only in the gym, but here on the field as well. There are 67 more siblings that I have so far.\"Since joining the team, Martinez has given around 80 interviews. Her face has appeared in the main newspapers of the country and has even occupied spaces on national television that Mexican college football players rarely get.Although it was not her goal, Martinez has become a symbol of women empowerment in a country considered lagging in inclusion issues. It is no surprise that before and after games many girls ask for a photo by her side.\"There are little girls and boys who come and ask me for a photo or come up and say very nice words to me,\" Martinez said. \"It's the most gratifying thing I've ever felt, being able to realize that, perhaps I'm inspiring them a little.\"Perhaps also inadvertently, Martinez's story is helping to bring more NFL fans to Mexico.Recently, in an interview with local media, Al Guido, the president of the San Francisco 49ers, said that coming to play a regular season game next November is part of a broader strategy to win over fans in the country.\"We don't want them to leave their ball behind,\" Guido said of soccer. \"We want them to also throw ours and have our logo on the chest.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.DETROIT (AP) -- The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for 50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday.Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things.Burks' Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying.They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks' brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car.\"Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You're OK,\" a member of the Detroit Police Department's crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. \"You're not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?\"\"You're not in any trouble, OK?\" the officer continued. \"I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you're going through, I can help you.\"Burks -- who police say had schizophrenia -- was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.Police officials have said 38 shots were fired in three seconds. Burks was struck 19 times, according to an autopsy report provided Tuesday by Fieger.Detroit police are conducting an internal administrative probe into the shooting, and the officers who fired shots at Burks have been placed on administrative leave. State police are also investigating and are expected to submit their findings to the Wayne County prosecutor's office. Police Chief James White told reporters at a news conference two days after Burks was shot that the mental health crisis in Detroit and around the nation \"is real.\"The Detroit Police Department will continue advocating for mental health resources, White said Tuesday in response to the lawsuit.The department also \"will take every opportunity to improve its response to people suffering from mental illness,\" White said in a statement.\"We firmly believe that if appropriate mental health facilities and treatment plans had been available, this situation may have been avoided,\" he said. \"Regrettably, the (department) remains the primary emergency response service for individuals suffering from mental health emergencies.\"On June 26, Burks was admitted to a Detroit hospital psychiatric ward after he was found walking in his neighborhood \"looking to fight someone,\" police said.He escaped two days later in hospital garb and was arrested by officers as he ran in and out of traffic.In August 2020, he stabbed his 7-year-old stepsister in the neck. That March, he stabbed his sister in the neck and his brother in the head.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Prosecutors might seek a grand jury indictment before then.Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson declined outside court to comment.Police said Thai and Officer Ryan Gillihan were summoned by Hampton's wife and mother-in-law to a street-side domestic dispute a few blocks east of the Las Vegas Strip. Authorities said the officers returned gunfire as Hampton shot at them with a high-powered pistol while driving away.Gillihan and Hampton's wife escaped injury, but police said Hampton's mother-in-law was wounded in the leg. Her injury was described as not life-threatening. Gillihan, a police officer since 2017, is on paid leave after the shooting.Hampton was arrested in his vehicle a short time later and remains jailed without bail. He also faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge. He has not yet entered pleas in the case.Thai, who died at age 49, was born in Vietnam and served for 23 years as a Las Vegas patrol and training officer, financial crimes investigator and firearms instructor.He was mourned last week with a long funeral procession on the casino-lined Las Vegas Strip and eulogized by former co-workers and family members before an audience of hundreds at an arena-sized church in suburban Henderson.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) -- Serbia said Tuesday it has placed its troops on the border with Kosovo on a heightened state of alert over a row about car license plates that has threatened to further escalate tensions between the two Balkan foes.Earlier, authorities warned members of the ethnic Serbian minority living in Kosovo, a former province of Serbia, to replace their vehicle registration plates with Kosovar ones. The warnings came despite calls from the U.S. and the European Union to postpone any such requirement. In response to Kosovo's move, Serbian Defense Minister Milos Vucevic said that President Aleksandar Vucic, who is the supreme commander of Serbia's armed forces, placed the military on a state of \"readiness.\"\"We are not getting ready for a war, but we must not be unprepared,\" Vucevic said. \"We are ready to continue our dialogue with Pristina.\"It was not clear what the state of readiness meant practically. The populist Serbian president has been prone to saber rattling when tensions get high with Kosovo, whose independence Belgrade does not recognize.Serbian state-controlled media reported later that unmarked drones appeared on the Kosovo-Serbia border \"observing the barracks and the positions\" of the Serbian army. The reports said Serbian fighter jets were scrambled under Vucic's \"command,\" but the drones left the Serbian airspace before the warplanes reached their targets. The reports could not be independently verified.The EU has told Kosovo and Serbia that they must normalize ties if they want to advance toward membership in the 27-nation bloc. Brussels and Washington recently have stepped up mediation efforts, fearing uncertainties over the war in Ukraine and Serbia's close ties with Russia could aggravate matters.Trouble started brewing in the summer over Serbia's and Kosovo's refusal to recognize each other's identity documents as well as car license plates. Kosovo Serbs living in the north erected roadblocks, sounded air raid sirens and fired guns into the air in protest of the move.In June Kosovo passed a law requiring vehicles with Serbian number plates to replace them with Kosovo ones. But following pressure from the United States and the EU and the tension in the Serb-populated north, it agreed to postpone implementation until Nov. 1.As the measure came into effect Tuesday, Kosovo authorities said enforcement would be gradual. For the first three weeks in November, drivers who fail to comply will receive warnings. After that they will be fined and from late January only vehicles with new temporary plates will be allowed to circulate until April 21, the final date after which no old license plates will be allowed and drivers risk the impounding of their vehicles.Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla urged ethnic Serbs Tuesday to comply, and not remain \"pawns to political interests.\" Last week Svecla said only 20 Serbs had changed plates and at least one of their cars was torched.Kosovo's 2008 independence has been recognized by Washington and most EU countries, while Serbia has relied on support from Moscow and China for its bid to retain the former province. Belgrade lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed the country to stop its brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatist rebels. NATO has a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and any Serbian military intervention would risk reviving widespread tensions that plunged the Balkans into a series of wars in the 1990s.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines pilots have overwhelmingly rejected a tentative contract, the latest move showing the resolve by airline unions to push for significant pay raises.The deal would have given pilots raises of nearly 15 over 18 months, according to the union.The Air Line Pilots Association said Tuesday that 94 of the nearly 10,000 United pilots who took part voted against a tentative agreement that the union and United reached in June.The union accused United of refusing to respond to its latest proposal on wages. The union said it is determined to win an industry-leading contract \"that fully recognizes our contributions to the success of our airline.\"A spokesman for Chicago-based United said the outcome of the vote was expected after the airline and the union identified issues with the June proposal. He said the the two sides are working on a new industry-leading agreement that is expected to include better pay rates and other improvements.The vote was announced one day after pilots at Delta approved a symbolic strike-authorization vote to protest the lack of a new contract.

All Rights Reserved.Brooklyn Nets head coach Steve Nash argues a call during the first half of an NBA basketball game Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2022, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Morry Gash)NEW YORK (AP) -- The Brooklyn Nets refused to fire Steve Nash over the summer, no matter what Kevin Durant wanted.But with the Nets off to a disappointing start amid more controversy surrounding Kyrie Irving, the team and coach both decided the change needed to happen now.\"We both felt this was time,\" general manager Sean Marks said. So the Nets parted ways with the Hall of Fame point guard Tuesday, hours before losing to Chicago to drop to 2-6.Nash made it to this season after Durant said he wanted him out this summer, but not much longer. The Nets have been another mess, with bad play on the court and bad headlines off it.The biggest -- again -- was created by Irving, who posted a link to an antisemitic work on his Twitter page last week, drawing criticism from Nets owner Joe Tsai.Marks said he and Nash had been talking for a week, perhaps more, before arriving at the decision that it was time for change. \"It was certainly trending that way and to be quite frank the team was not doing what it was supposed to be doing,\" Marks said. \"We've fallen from our goals and of meeting our goals and it was time now because we still have lofty aspirations of where we need get to.\" Marks said players were not consulted, but Durant said there wouldn't have been any need because everyone knew the situation the Nets were in. \"Let's be real. We're pros, we're veterans,\" Durant said. \"We had a tough start. It was a rocky year last year, rocky summer. We knew that everybody was being evaluated. That's just how it is in the league.\" The Nets may move quickly to replace Nash. A person with knowledge of the matter said the Nets were in discussions with suspended Boston coach Ime Udoka -- a former Brooklyn assistant who is not with the Celtics this season because he was found to have violated team rules by having a relationship with a female staffer within the organization. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because those talks were not revealed publicly.ESPN first reported the talks between Udoka and the Nets. The Nets said a decision on the team's next coach would be made in the near future.Marks denied that he had decided on a coach and wouldn't give a list of candidates. He also wouldn't discuss whether Udoka would be accepted in Brooklyn so soon after his troubles in Boston.\"But I would say I will reserve that for when those decisions are made and I couldn't give you a timeline on that,\" Marks said. \"Obviously there's a reason why we made this move when we did, because time is ticking. So we do want this process to be a thorough one, we're not going to skip steps on that and then we'll do our due diligence like in any way. When I was hired, when anybody was hired the organization does very, very thorough due diligence on anybody, and you arrive at the best possible outcome.\" Nash led the Nets to a 92-62 record and the playoffs in both full seasons, his first as an NBA coach. But they lost Irving and James Harden to injuries during their second-round loss to Milwaukee in 2021, then were a first-round flop last season after trading Harden during the middle of the season.Much of the Nets' problems during the latter season were caused by Irving being unavailable for most of their home games because he refused to get vaccinated for the coronavirus, as mandated at the time in New York City.Nash handled it all as best as possible, but apparently not good enough for his best player. Durant said he wanted to be traded this summer if the Nets didn't fire Marks and Nash, but Tsai stood by them and Durant eventually pulled back his request.Nash downplayed that before this season began, saying he didn't believe the reports were entirely true and that they had quickly talked through their issues.But things started poorly this season and Nash gave some of his hardest criticism of the team during his tenure after their loss to Indiana on Saturday night, calling their defensive effort a \"disaster\" and saying he didn't see desire or will. \"We have to look deep, deep inside ourselves and what we want to do, what we want to accomplish,\" Nash said. \"Do we want to give up on this because it's been difficult early, or do we want to stay the course and start to build something?\" Much of that was ignored because the focus was on Irving's combative news conference defending his tweet, and the Nets beat the Pacers in the rematch Monday to end a four-game skid. But Nash's tenure ended anyway a day later, hours before Brooklyn is set to host Chicago. Jacque Vaughn served as acting head coach against the Bulls.Tsai alluded to the constant turbulence around the team in his statement thanking Nash.\"My admiration and respect for him grew over time as he brought hard work and positive attitude to our organization every day, even in periods of exceptional storm surrounding the team,\" Tsai said. Nash thanked the Tsai family and Marks for giving him the opportunity, calling the job \"an amazing experience with many challenges that I'm incredibly grateful for.\"Marks chose his former teammate as coach in 2020 despite no experience in the job, citing Nash's ability to be a connector of personalities as a player. Nash was a two-time MVP with the Phoenix Suns who ended his 18-year career third on the NBA's list with 10,335 assists.But his schemes were criticized as the Nets struggled defensively throughout his tenure and often didn't show the ball-moving style of play on offense that his Suns teams did, instead relying on Durant, Irving or Harden to isolate.Beyond the player changes, Nash also had to adapt to changes on his bench. Mike D'Antoni, the two-time NBA Coach of the Year, stepped down as his assistant after one season, and Udoka left to become coach of the Celtics.AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this story.AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Tioga Road through Yosemite National Park also was closed. The weather service said the heaviest precipitation was expected in Northern California, with lighter totals across Southern California. \"While much needed, this precipitation will not make much of a dent in the extreme to exceptional drought that continues to plague much of California,\" forecasters wrote.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)Visitors look toward the North side at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, South Korea, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward the sea on Friday in its first ballistic weapons launches in two weeks, as the U.S. military warned the North that the use of nuclear weapons \"will result in the end of that regime.\" (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea issued a veiled threat Tuesday to use nuclear weapons to get the U.S. and South Korea to \"pay the most horrible price in history,\" an escalation of its fiery rhetoric targeting the ongoing large-scale military drills between its rivals.Animosities on the Korean Peninsula have been running high in recent months, with North Korea testing a string of nuclear-capable missiles and adopting a law authorizing the preemptive use of its nuclear weapons in a broad range of situations. Some experts still doubt North Korea could use nuclear weapons first in the face of more superior U.S. and South Korean forces.North Korea has argued its recent weapons tests were meant to issue a warning to Washington and Seoul over their series of joint military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal, including this week's exercises involving about 240 warplanes. Pak Jong Chon, a secretary of the ruling Workers' Party who is considered a close confidant of leader Kim Jong Un, called the so-called \"Vigilant Storm\" air force drills \"aggressive and provocative.\"Pak also accused the Pentagon of formulating a North Korean regime collapse as a major policy objective in an apparent reference to the Pentagon's recently released National Defense Strategy report. The report stated any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies and partners \"will result in the end of that regime.\"He slammed South Korean military leaders over what he called \"rubbish\" comments that threatened to destroy North Korea if it uses nuclear weapons. South Korea's military has warned North Korea that using its nuclear weapons would put it on a \"path of self-destruction.\" \"If the U.S. and South Korea attempt to use armed forces against (North Korea) without any fear, the special means of the (North's) armed forces will carry out their strategic mission without delay,\" Pak said, in an apparent reference to his country's nuclear weapons. \"The U.S. and South Korea will have to face a terrible case and pay the most horrible price in history,\" he said.U.S. and South Korean officials have steadfastly said their drills are defensive in nature and that they have no intentions of attacking North Korea.Pak's statement is the North's second warning to the United States and South Korea this week. On Monday, the North's Foreign Ministry warned of \"more powerful follow-up measures\" in response to its rivals' air force drills. South Korean officials have said North Korea could up the ante in coming weeks by detonating its first nuclear test device since September 2017, which could possibly take the country a step closer to its goals of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal capable of threatening regional U.S. allies and the American mainland. Some experts say North Korea would eventually want to use its expanded nuclear arsenal as a leverage in future negotiations with the United States to win sanctions relief and other concessions.

Hockenson (88) reacts after his successful two-point conversion catch during the second half of an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, Oct. 2, 2022, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Duane Burleson)MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings acquired tight end T.J. Hockenson from the division rival Detroit Lions a few hours before the NFL trade deadline on Tuesday, giving the NFC North leader another skill-position standout for a high-caliber offense. The Vikings simply downgraded two draft picks with no net loss to make the swap with the Lions. They sent a 2023 second-rounder and a 2024 third-rounder for the Lions, for a 2023 fourth-rounder and a conditional 2024 fourth-rounder. The deal, which was pending completion of Hockenson passing a physical exam, came two days after a serious ankle injury for primary Vikings tight end Irv Smith Jr. The Lions (1-6) previously picked up Hockenson's fifth-year contract option for 2023, so the Vikings (6-1) are getting more than just a short-term rental from a last-place team going through another rebuilding process. Hockenson has been one of the league's most productive pass-catching tight ends since the Lions picked him eighth overall in the first round of the 2019 draft out of Iowa. He made the Pro Bowl in 2020 and has 2,068 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns on 186 receptions in 47 games, having missed the last four games of his rookie year with torn ankle ligaments and a broken leg and missed the final five games of last season for a thumb injury that needed surgery.The Vikings now have another proven field-stretching option for quarterback Kirk Cousins to pass to and help keep some of the opposing defensive attention off wide receiver Justin Jefferson and running back Dalvin Cook. With 395 receiving yards, Hockenson has the highest seven-game total of his career. He has a league-leading average of 15.2 yards per catch among qualifying tight ends.The Vikings are last in the NFL with an average of 7.3 yards per reception by a tight end, according to Sportradar data. Vikings tight ends also have four dropped passes, tied for the fourth-highest team total in the league.The Vikings placed Smith on injured reserve on Tuesday, meaning he must sit out for a minimum of four games. He was hurt when he was blocking in front of running back Alexander Mattison during a touchdown pass from Cousins to K.J. Osborn in the fourth quarter on Sunday against Arizona. Mattison lost his balance and fell into the back of Smith's leg.Hockenson will carry a salary cap hit in 2023 of more than 9.3 million. Smith will become a free agent after this season.Johnny Mundt, who caught his first career touchdown pass against the Cardinals, has played 223 snaps (48) for the Vikings. Smith has played 253 snaps (54). With backup Ben Ellefson also on injured reserve, the Vikings recently signed six-year veteran Jacob Hollister for additional depth.Coach Kevin O'Connell called Mundt's performance \"ultra-consistent\" on Monday, but he also made clear the Vikings were seeking more impact in the passing game from that position. Smith, who missed the entire 2021 season with a knee injury, was being counted on to provide that.\"That's our job as a staff to continue to give Kirk all of the weapons and possibilities to make five eligible come to life,\" O'Connell said on Monday, before the trade was made. \"I expect a lot out of that room when their number is called.\"AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

At an antique store with long johns hanging from the rafters, he tried to buy old license plates to commemorate the day, only to be told that someone else had spoken for them.It was at the restored train depot that he got down to the business of the day, fielding a question about how a small-town government without a staff could possibly get its sliver of the infrastructure pie.Landrieu kept it simple: Work with other communities.\"All of you are small, medium or large, but none of you has everything you need to do anything on your own,\" he said. \"So, this is kindergarten stuff. I don't know if your mama sent you to school with a sandwich and some potato chips, but you wanted somebody's MM's. And you had to learn how to trade and make friends.\"Landrieu speaks often with anecdotes and metaphors, the New Orleans accent offering a below the Mason-Dixon Line bonhomie to the audience. He uses the language of chatty simplicity to explain the big ideas that can get lost in a divided country.And he comes bearing gifts, the promise of jobs and dramatic local improvements. For nearly a year, Landrieu has barnstormed a country with that same message of what's possible when people work together, even in a bitterly polarized era playing out before the midterm elections.What Landrieu has seen is just how much effort it takes to get the money to where it matters -- and to get a small measure of credit for the administration for progress that can seem like it's coming at glacial speed.What's riding on that 1 trillion? It's more than just whether Democrats can retain the House and Senate. There's the survival of thousands of American communities that need some combination of jobs, road improvements, new sewage pipes, high-speed internet and help to fight climate change.Landrieu sees himself playing the role of a bridge. But where he goes from here is an open question. The son of a mayor and the sister of a former U.S. senator, Landrieu is often mentioned as a possible presidential candidate and could benefit from traveling the country to dole out cash for local projects. After multiple hurricanes and a devastating oil spill, Landrieu redeveloped his home city as mayor from 2010 to 2018. He made the controversial decision to remove its Confederate statues, jumpstarting a national conversation on race. Soon came a pair of fateful phone calls that brought him to Washington.Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, phoned Landrieu about a year ago to ask if he would be willing to talk with Biden about how to implement the biggest infrastructure infusion of cash since the 1950s. \"Sure -- the president can call me any time he wants,\" Landrieu recalled answering. Deese phoned back the next day. \"Well, I talked to the president and he would like you to come up and run the thing.\" \"What thing?\" Landrieu said. \"The whole infrastructure thing,\" said Deese. Nearly a year later in the orange haze of dawn, Landrieu, 62, whistled as he strolled through the wood-beamed terminal of the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. \"I love airports because they make me think that we're going to be OK in America,\" Landrieu said last week after climbing into a Ford SUV. \"You've got to believe that that airport was full of people that thought differently and acted differently, but nobody was yelling and screaming. And everybody had one purpose: to get where the hell we're going.\" Even if they share a destination, though, they may not always agree on the road to get there. Administration officials love to point out how Republicans who voted against the infrastructure bill are nonetheless seeking its cash for local projects, and even taking credit for them. But Republican governors want more flexibility with how to spend the money, saying the rules can increase costs at a time of high inflation.Landrieu said action on long-delayed infrastructure projects can't foster \"political\" unity, but it can create a sense of \"national\" unity -- if the American public and its leaders look past divisions on abortion, civil rights and more to focus on shared goals.The challenge is that it's still early for voters to appreciate projects that are generational in scale. Landrieu explains the dilemma by referencing the French post-impressionist artist Georges Seurat and his painting \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grade Jatte.\" The painting of Parisians on the banks of the Seine is composed entirely of colorful dots of paint that, when viewed at a distance, form a full picture. So far, Landrieu says, the infrastructure effort is just a bunch of dots on the canvas. He's trying to sell people on how those dots connect. Since February, Landrieu has gone to 37 cities, encouraging government officials and businesses to apply for infrastructure grants and loans. Some 6,000 projects are already under way. He numbers his conversations with governors, mayors and others in the thousands. That suggests he's reaching much more deeply into Republican territory than Biden, who can be a lightning rod for GOP criticism.Landrieu has gotten roughly 185 billion in infrastructure spending out the door. His trip to North Carolina with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack last week was to announce 759 million to lay broadband fiber for internet in rural counties. That sum is a lifeline for places like Warren County in North Carolina. Census figures show it lost more than 11 of its population between 2010 and 2020. A fast internet connection is a must for businesses and residents to stay. \"What I hear often is I cannot find a place in Warren County that gives me the speed that I need,\" said Charla Duncan, the county's community and economic development director. Landrieu listened intently as Duncan spoke during a roundtable with Vilsack and North Carolina officials. When Gov. Roy Cooper said that one million North Carolina residents lack high-speed internet, Landrieu registered that number with his eyes. He would use it later that day in Elm City.Landrieu has been giving voters a deeply political message ahead of the midterm elections, trying to convey that Biden cares about them and is improving the capacity of government to meet their needs. It's an uphill battle as high inflation weighs on the minds of voters and has left Biden's approval rating at just 43. As a scion of a Louisiana political dynasty, Landrieu has spent his life dwelling on the gap between how governments function and how they should operate. He was a state legislator and lieutenant governor before serving as New Orleans mayor. His father, Moon, held the same job when Mitch was a child and teenager. On the day Landrieu was born in 1960, he says, his father was one of two state representatives to vote against segregation, and racial, class and other divides have always been a part of how he thinks. He studied the political divisions after removing New Orleans' Confederate monuments and starting the nonprofit E Pluribus Unum. He traveled across the South and talked with coal miners in West Virginia who felt abandoned by government leaders. He sees infrastructure as a vehicle for economic opportunity, yet demurred when asked if he planned to stay in his post as he said he serves at \"the president's pleasure.\" Landrieu suggested his fate could change after the Nov. 8 elections and the possible ascension of the GOP to House and Senate majorities. \"We'll see what happens in a couple of weeks and then the world changes dramatically around here,\" he said. \"I don't really know the answer to that question.\" Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Moldova is entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas. As Sandu addressed Romanian lawmakers, the country's breakaway Trans-Dniester region stopped supplying the rest of Moldova with electricity. The Moscow-backed separatist region is home to Moldova's largest gas-operated power station, which supplies about 70 of the country's electricity needs. The power supply interruption followed a Monday announcement from Moldova's infrastructure minister, Andrei Spinu, that the state power company, Energocom, had failed to sign a November contract with the plant due to a 40 cut in deliveries of Russian natural gas. Spinu said Russian gas giant Gazprom agreed to supply Moldova with 5.7 million cubic meters of gas per day, just 51 of what the country needs to provide electricity for its 2.6 million people. Russia has used impoverished Moldova's dependence on its gas to pressure the country over its alignment with the West, including the condemnation of the war in Ukraine. Household energy tariffs have gone up six-fold in the last year. Gazprom has repeatedly threatened to cut off the former Soviet republic's pipelines altogether. Moldova became a candidate for European Union membership in June, at the same time as neighboring Ukraine did. \"Providing electricity for the country is a daily challenge. ... Moldovan families now spend about 75 of their income on energy,\" Sandu told Romanian lawmakers. ''We risk being without gas and electricity during the coming winter.\" Sandu also accused pro-Russia political forces in Moldova of \"cynically exploiting people's hardships and the discontent ... (to) generate chaos and turn us back from our European path.\"She cited over 20 Moldovan and Russian individuals and entities sanctioned by the U.S. last week for assisting Russian efforts to manipulate Moldova's politics. The group included Ilan Shor, an Israel-based Moldovan oligarch and the leader of the populist Shor Party. His supporters staged days-long protests in Moldova's capital last month chanting slogans against the government's pro-Western policies and carrying banners with slogans such as \"No to Cold War, no to cold winter.\" The State Department said Shor was working with \"corrupt oligarchs and Moscow-based entities to create political unrest in Moldova\" and to undermine the country's efforts to join the European Union. Sandu similarly accused \"corrupt\" political actors in Moldova of pushing for Russia's interests while the violence from the Kremlin's war in Ukraine spills into their country. On Monday, a Russian missile landed in a Moldovan border city when Ukrainian forces shot it down. Residents of Naslavcea said they were shaken by the explosion, which caused damage but no casualties. \"We were scared, I did not know what to do or where to go,\" resident Yelena Shakrai said. Russia has previously fired missiles over Moldova into Ukraine, but Monday's incident was the first of its kind. The Moldovan Foreign Ministry responded by expelling a Russian Embassy employee from its territory. \"We are all in danger, as there are no rules or limits for Russia. ... We need help to survive as a part of the free world,\" Sandu said.

Cartier caught the attention of Colorado State. (Macabe Brown/Evansville Courier  Press via AP, File)MARYVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- There is growing fear among college basketball coaches at the lower levels of the sport, the vast majority of which do not make seven-figure salaries, fly around the country in private jets or hang out with rich and famous boosters and fans.It's a fear that comes with success.It only takes a couple of marquee players to compete for championships at the Division II or III level, the NAIA or even in low-major Division I leagues. But in an era of freedom of transfer an d name, image and likeness endorsement money, the reality is this: If your program is too good, there's a good chance those prolific players will be playing elsewhere next season, recruited to major programs that can offer them more exposure, opportunities and financial benefits.When it happens, lower-level coaches who might be coming off a 20-win season could be left rebuilding their rosters and fighting for 10 wins and, potentially, their jobs.\"There's always been an opportunity to poach kids if you want to poach them, but it's all become easier now,\" said Joe Lombardi, the longtime coach of Division II powerhouse Indiana (Pa.). \"I believe in karma. I'm not doing that, OK? But some places it has become a way of life. It's disappointing that people invest in kids and, you know, they get poached.\"They don't just go to the market,\" Lombardi added. \"Some do, but a lot of them are talked into it.\"His team reached the Final Four last season thanks largely to shooting guard Armoni Foster, who averaged 18 points for the Crimson Hawks, but who will be playing Division I ball for Buffalo this season. And while Lombardi encouraged him to seek a better opportunity for his final year of eligibility, the coach acknowledges that won't always be the case.Especially when players no longer have to sit out a year under the NCAA's transfer rules.\"I've had guys that Division I schools made overtures about and I'm eventually going to lose someone, and it might not be amicable,\" Lombardi said. \"I might not be happy with the move. But if you're in it long enough, that will happen.\"It happened at Nova Southeastern, the top seed in the NCAA Tournament last year. Sekou Sylla, who averaged 22.4 points and 10.4 rebounds for the Division II program, will be playing for Towson at the Division I level this season.And it happened at Hillsdale, another strong Division II program, where Patrick Cartier caught the attention of Colorado State. And at Bentley, which saw shooting guard Colton Lawrence follow up a strong season by leaving for Maryland-Baltimore County, a low-major program but nonetheless an opportunity for him to compete at the Division I level.Even the bluest of the bluebloods have kept their eyes open for lower-level transfers. Cam Martin, a bruising 6-foot-9 forward, was a two-time All-American for Missouri Southern who chose to continue his career elsewhere. He landed at Kansas, the defending Division I national champion, about a 3-hour drive from the Lions' campus in Joplin but light years away in terms of opportunity and experience.Martin, who graduated from Missouri Southern and is pursuing his graduate degree at Kansas, went from starting every game and playing major minutes to being a key practice player but rarely seeing the floor in actual games.\"You have the good and bad stories that come of it,\" acknowledged Dennis Gates, the new Missouri coach who brought three players with him when he was hired from Cleveland State. \"But the rules give student-athletes an opportunity, no different than coaches have opportunities now, to represent a different program.\"Still, as TCU coach Jamie Dixon admitted, the fact that players no longer have to sit out has changed the dynamic.\"A kid having success at a lower conference than, say, the Big 12, was likely not to transfer and sit out because he's playing well,\" he said. \"He's getting his minutes. Why would he want to sit out?\"When the NCAA removed that impediment, it became easier for players to move on -- and move up. And when NIL legislation came along, allowing players to profit off their celebrity, it created a situation where high-major programs can effectively offer financial benefits unavailable at most lower-level programs.Throw in the chance to compete at a higher level and it's hard for kids to turn their back on the opportunity.Fardaws Aimaq remembers playing for Utah Valley in the WAC Tournament last spring, and five or six NBA scouts were sitting in a corner. Aimaq dominated the first half of the Wolverines' game, only to see the scouts get up and walk out, and he recalled thinking, \"Why did they leave?\" Aimaq texted his advisers afterward, and the answer was simple: \"They wanted to know if I was really that good or the competition was not that good.\"Aimaq ended up transferring from the low-major school to Texas Tech in the hopes of raising his NBA draft profile this season.\"Leaving was hard,\" he said, \"but it was just the best decision for me business-wise.\"Just like it was for Malachi Smith, a prolific shooting guard who spent the last two seasons at Chattanooga but will play for Gonzaga this season, or Johni Broome, a 6-10 forward who transferred from Morehead State to Auburn. Transfers go both ways, of course. Plenty of players leave high-majors for low-majors, or even lower divisions, where they might go from benchwarmer to starter. But they are typically easier for big-budget programs to replace.It's tougher to accept at small schools, though, when a player who might have slipped through the recruiting cracks not only got an opportunity to play but was also developed over time -- only to take their game somewhere else.\"There could be a great player at Division III. I will not make an overture for that kid. I will not do it,\" said Lombardi, the Division II coach at Indiana (Pa.) \"Maybe I would if I was 10-20 for three straight seasons -- I might then. But I just don't think it's for the good of the kid or the good of athletics.\"AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Iraq's new Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said Tuesday, Nov. 1, that he hopes to continue hosting talks in Iraq between regional arch-enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran during his tenure.(Iraqi Parliament Media Office via AP)BAGHDAD (AP) -- Iraq's new Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said Tuesday that he hopes to continue hosting talks in Iraq between regional arch-enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran during his tenure.Speaking at his first press conference since his government received the parliament's vote of confidence on Thursday, al-Sudani said his administration had received signs of interest in Iraq continuing to facilitate a dialogue between the two countries. \"We were asked to continue,\" he said, without elaborating.Iraq has hosted several rounds of direct talks between officials from the two regional rivals since last year, though the talks have so far produced few results.Saudi Arabia has sought talks with Iran as the kingdom tries to end its years-long war in Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.Al-Sudani's government is the first in Iraq since 2005 that does not include seats from the political bloc of influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The confirmation of the new Cabinet last week ended a yearlong political stalemate punctuated by outbreaks of street violence, amid which al-Sadr withdrew his bloc from parliament. The government has promised to fight corruption, speed up reconstruction of areas damaged by armed conflict and return the displaced to their homes. It also calls for the elimination of \"uncontrolled weapons\" held by non-state actors.In Tuesday's remarks, al-Sudani promised to focus on the \"return of stolen Iraqi funds\" that may have been transferred abroad and said he will hold talks with U.S.-led forces in Iraq to understand the needs of Iraqi security forces. These include training needs and the number of coalition troops required. U.S.-led coalition forces have officially ended their combat mission in Iraq, but continue to play an advisory role to Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State extremist group.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz)LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska quarterback Casey Thompson is listed as day-to-day for the game against Minnesota on Saturday because of an arm injury that knocked him out of last week's game.Interim coach Mickey Joseph said Thompson was held out of practice Tuesday and backups Chubba Purdy and Logan Smothers split snaps evenly with the No. 1 offense.Thompson, the Texas transfer who has started every game for the Huskers (3-5, 2-3 Big Ten), was hurt in the second quarter while throwing an interception. He got hit on the elbow on his right (throwing) arm, causing numbness in his hand.Smothers played the rest of the first half and Purdy took over at the start of the second. The Cornhuskers, who lost 26-9, managed only 29 yards after halftime.Smothers is considered the better runner and Purdy the better passer. Smothers' only start was last year in a 28-21 loss at Iowa. Purdy is in his first year at Nebraska after transferring from Florida State.Joseph said he went with Purdy in the second half because he thought the Huskers, down double digits, would need to pass more. The Huskers had only 20 offensive plays in the second half and passed on eight, with Purdy completing three for 15 yards and throwing an ill-advised interception.\"He plays nervous sometimes and I just want him to breathe and calm down because (then) he plays better,\" Joseph said. \"He's got to have more poise behind the center when he goes in a game. He wants to make a play so bad that he makes a bad play. We've got to do a better job as coaches to get him ready.\"AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox hired Kansas City Royals bench coach Pedro Grifol to replace Hall of Famer Tony La Russa as their manager, a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the hiring. ESPN first reported the move.The 52-year-old Grifol will try to lift a team coming off a disappointing season. The White Sox finished second in the AL Central at 81-81 and missed the playoffs after running away with the division in 2021. La Russa missed the final 34 games because of health problems and announced he would not return, ending a disappointing two-year run with the franchise that gave him his first job as a big league skipper.Grifol spent the past 10 seasons in a variety of coaching roles with Kansas City under former managers Ned Yost and Mike Matheny. He was part of teams that captured back-to-back pennants and won the World Series in 2015.Grifol spent the past three seasons as the Royals bench coach. He interviewed for the managing job after Matheny was fired as part of a widespread shakeup within the organization after a 65-97 finish -- Kansas City's sixth straight losing season. The Royals hired Tampa Bay Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro as manager on Sunday night.Grifol previously spent 13 seasons coaching, scouting and managing in the Seattle Mariners' system. He was also a minor league catcher who played nine seasons in the Minnesota Twins and New York Mets organizations. The previous four managers hired by the White Sox were either working for them or had ties to the franchise, including former players Ozzie Guillen and Robin Ventura. Rick Renteria, La Russa's predecessor, spent the 2016 season as Ventura's bench coach before getting promoted.The White Sox began the season with championship aspirations after making the playoffs the previous two years. But they were plagued by injuries and inconsistent play.All-Star shortstop Tim Anderson and sluggers Eloy Jimenez and Luis Robert missed significant time because of injuries. Catcher Yasmani Grandal and third baseman Yoan Moncada also had health issues, and they underperformed when they were on the field.There were embarrassing breakdowns, too, such as when the White Sox ran themselves into the first 8-5 triple play in major league history during a loss to Minnesota on July 4.The team showed some spark after La Russa stepped away from the team on Aug. 30. The White Sox won 10 of their first 14 games under bench coach Miguel Cairo, but they lost eight straight in September, dashing their playoff hopes.The White Sox finished the season with more errors (101) than all but two teams. Their lineup was heavy on right-handed hitters, and they had maybe a few too many players more suited for first base and designated hitter roles.AP Sports Writer David Skretta in Kansas City contributed to this report.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Former Kansas and New Mexico forward Gethro Muscadin died late Monday from injuries he sustained in a single-car rollover crash in December, Jayhawks coach Bill Self announced Tuesday.\"Although only here one year,\" Self said, \"Gethro was loved and liked by all and will always be remembered as a Jayhawk. We wish his family and loved ones the best going through this most difficult time.\"Muscadin, 22, grew up in the seaside city of Gonaives, Haiti, and moved to the U.S. in 2006 to pursue basketball. He played at Sunrise Christian Academy and Life Prep Academy, both in Kansas, along with Aspire Academy in Kentucky, where he grew into a four-star prospect that had scholarship offers from a number of high-major programs.The 6-foot-10 center chose the Jayhawks and appeared in 11 games during the 2020-21 season, including a loss to Southern California in the NCAA Tournament, and was teammates with many on last season's national championship team.Muscadin transferred to New Mexico after the season, starting nine of 12 games and averaging 9.3 points before leaving the program last December. At the time, Lobos coach Richard Pitino called it a mutual decision to part ways.Muscadin had returned to Kansas to watch the Jayhawks play Nevada and was traveling to Wichita afterward when the crash happened on a stretch of interstate. According to the Kansas Highway Patrol, Muscadin was not wearing a seatbelt when the vehicle \"went off the road, rolled multiple times, and came to rest on the fence line\" south of Topeka.Self said Muscadin, who turned 22 in August, had been in a \"non-responsive state\" since the crash.The driver, Alaceyia Howard, was hospitalized with minor injuries from the crash.\"The Lobo community is saddened today by the passing of former New Mexico basketball player Gethro Muscadin,\" the program tweeted Tuesday. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this time.\"This story has been corrected to show that Muscadin was 22, not 20.AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Khris Middleton still isn't in uniform as he recovers from offseason wrist surgery.Yet the Milwaukee Bucks still have played well enough to become the NBA's last unbeaten team.The Bucks (6-0) benefited from having a season-high, six-game homestand immediately after opening with a 90-88 triumph at Philadelphia. They close that stretch Wednesday night with the second of two straight games against the Detroit Pistons.Milwaukee also has capitalized on a defense that has grown stingier with the return of a healthy Brook Lopez.\"Our team is definitely the best defensive team in the NBA,\" Lopez said Monday after the Bucks' 110-108 victory over the Pistons. \"That's something we can do every night, regardless of how we're shooting.\"The Bucks lead the NBA in scoring defense (103.8) and field-goal percentage defense (.423). Lopez has a league-high 3.3 blocks per game after recovering from a back injury that required surgery and limited him to 13 regular-season games last year.That's enabled the Bucks to remain unbeaten even while ranking just 23rd in field-goal percentage (.451) and 24th in 3-point percentage (.335). Antetokounmpo has said he wants the Bucks to have a suffocating defense as their identity rather than assuming they can beat teams by scoring in bunches every night.\"I've been a part of a team like that. The 2019-2020 team, we were a team that scored a lot of points and we beat everybody by 12-13-15 points on average,\" Antetokounmpo said last week, referring to a season in which the Bucks posted the NBA's best regular-season record but lost in the second round of the playoffs. \"But at the end of the day, it comes down to stops, who get the most stops down the stretch, who makes that extra effort, whos' going to dive for the ball, who's going to cover for one another, who's going to rebound the ball better, who's going to get more 50-50 balls.\"That defense has helped Milwaukee withstand the absences of Middleton and Pat Connaughton, who also hasn't played yet this season due to a strained right calf. Of course, it helps to have arguably the world's best player on your roster. Antetokounmpo, the reigning Eastern Conference player of the week, scored 151 points in a four-game run that ended Saturday with a 123-115 triumph over the Atlanta Hawks. That's his highest career point total over a four-game span.\"He's what the game should be about - the way he plays with intensity, his work ethic,\" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \"He's not about the frills and the fancy stuff. He just gets it done. That's what's grown over the years with his game. You could probably trick him a few years ago. You're not going to trick him anymore.\"Antetokounmpo isn't satisfied. The two-time MVP said over the weekend that he still doesn't have that feeling and rhythm that he usually gets when he's delivering big-time performances.\"I'm still chasing that feeling,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I want to help my team be great. I want to be as efficient as possible for this team. I want to win games. It doesn't really matter the numbers - I'm just chasing that feeling, that hunger where things just happen automatic, like when you trust your skills, when you get to the free-throw line you knock down your shots. It's a feeling. I haven't had it yet.\"Milwaukee returned its roster virtually intact from last season, and the Bucks' experience playing together has paid off down the stretch in close wins over Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit.Jrue Holiday is averaging 29.5 points and 11 assists over his last two games and made a tie-breaking 3-pointer in the final minute Monday. Lopez has 15.3 points per gameBut it's the defense that's making the biggest difference.\"That's ultimately what helps you win big games and close out big games - the defensive side of the ball,\" forward Bobby Portis said. \"That's what we've really got to keep up. Shots will start to fall, hopefully, one day for us.\"AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Rolls of \"I Voted Early\" stickers await voters in the final hours of early voting in the primary election in Noblesville, Ind., May 2, 2022. Election Day is still 12 days away. But in courtrooms across the country, efforts to sow doubt over the outcome have already begun. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)FILE - Election workers perform a recount of ballots from the recent Pennsylvania primary election at the Allegheny County Election Division warehouse on the Northside of Pittsburgh, June 1, 2022. Unlike in many other countries, elections in the U.S. are highly decentralized, complex and feature a long list of races on the ballot, from president or Congress all the way down to local ballot measures or town council seats. Rules also vary greatly by state. Some give local election offices several weeks before Election Day to process mailed ballots, which includes steps that may include checking signatures or ID information. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)When is early voting over in the midterm elections?Well, where do you live?All states have their own rules and deadlines for ballots cast before Election Day, by mail or in person. Early voting got a big boost in 2020, when many states made the practice more available, as the nation voted amid the coronavirus pandemic. Voters made use of it, too, with an unprecedented 103.2 million people casting early ballots in the presidential election, eager to avoid long lines and crowded polling stations, or simply drop off their ballots in official collection boxes Now, as the early voting period winds down for the 2022 midterm elections, a look at when things are slated to wrap up:Every state offers the opportunity to cast early ballots -- some by mail, some in person, some both. For places with in-person early voting, the windows in which someone can cast an early ballot vary from more than a month to just over a week.Early voting and in-person absentee voting starts as early as nearly six weeks ahead of Election Day itself in places such as Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, South Dakota, Vermont and Virginia.In a lot of places, in-person, early voting is open right up to Election Day itself. Others, including Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Ohio accept voters until the day before the election.Some, like New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina -- where the practice is new this year -- and Oklahoma wrap up the process the Saturday before Election Day. And Louisiana closes its early polls a week before Election Day itself.Watch more from AP's Meg Kinnard on TikTok.In a number of states, voters can cast their ballots early by mail. Most places require that mail-in ballots be postmarked by Election Day, but many states will accept them in the weeks following the election. Illinois accepts mail-in ballots two weeks after the election, while Maryland and Ohio will accept ballots up to 10 days post-election.In Colorado, where all registered voters receive mail-in ballots automatically, most votes are cast this way, although there are some in-person voting centers. Ballots can be dropped off up until the polls close.Michigan requires its mail-in ballots to be received by the time polls close, as do other states including Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Before early mail-in votes can be counted, they have to be processed. This means that elections officials open up any paper ballots, verify signatures and sort them into correct piles.When all of that can start varies state-to-state. Some places can get a head start, while others have to wait until Election Day itself, which can make some vote counts long and chaotic.Some states can start processing ballots as early as three weeks before Election Day. Counting can even start ahead of poll closings, too.In New Jersey, early mail votes can be processed before Election Day and counted before the polls close.In Washington, D.C., these votes can't be processed until Election Day and can't be counted until after the polls close.Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAPCheck out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.Follow AP's coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Michelle Lujan Grisham at Keller Hall, in Albuquerque, N.M., Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2022. (Eddie Moore/The Albuquerque Journal via AP)SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Republicans are funneling resources and determination into a law-and-order campaign for governor of New Mexico led by a local TV celebrity with a hard-line message about criminal justice -- hoping to dislodge an incumbent Democrat who staunchly defends abortion access.New Mexico is one of a handful of Democratic-dominated states from New York to Oregon where Republicans hope to win the top statewide office by elevating concerns about household hardships of inflation along with rising crime and shifting attitudes about public safety.Former TV meteorologist and GOP nominee Mark Ronchetti has relentlessly hammered incumbent Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for fostering a \"catch-and-release\" environment in the criminal justice system as the state's largest city, Albuquerque, sees a record-setting spate of homicides.He's drawing support from a pack of ambitious GOP governors with little love for former President Donald Trump. Fundraising by Ronchetti's campaign has surged amid visits from incumbent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, termed-out Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and purple-state Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.On Monday, Trump posted a social media endorsement of Ronchetti, who has steered clear of Trump's false election-fraud claims that sparked the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and acknowledges that President Joe Biden won in 2020.Biden is scheduled to visit New Mexico on Thursday to shore up Lujan Grisham's standing with voters in a state that Trump lost twice -- and where Democrats hope to keep control of every statewide elected office, legislative majorities and the state Supreme Court.Lujan Grisham has staked her reelection above all on abortion access as a cornerstone of women's rights -- touting her collaboration with Democratic legislators in overturning a dormant state abortion ban last year ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court striking down Roe vs. Wade. She later signed executive orders to ensure safe haven for local abortion doctors and visiting patients, while earmarking 10 million to help build an abortion and reproductive health clinic in Las Cruces.If \"women don't have equal rights, you cannot have a democracy,\" Lujan Grisham told news reporters last week. \"It's perilous.\"Biden's trip to New Mexico comes on the heels of visits and endorsements by prominent Democrats, from a video feed by Barack Obama to a moderated discussion on reproductive rights in Albuquerque last week between Lujan Grisham and Vice President Kamala Harris.Ronchetti spokesman Ryan Sabel said Monday that the Biden visit would remind voters of reckless policies that \"have led to higher gas prices, open borders, and drugs and violent crime taking over our neighborhoods.\"Lonna Atkeson, a political scientist who directs the LeRoy Collins Institute at Florida State University, said Republicans have seized on the most visceral of political issues.\"Crime really affects people, and the economy is more important than crime,\" she said. \"As long as you can keep these issues in the minds of voters, the GOP has a winning strategy.\"Atkeson, a former professor at the University of New Mexico, said campaigning on abortion policy can activate voters across the political spectrum in a heavily Hispanic state with strong currents of Catholicism.\"We've got both right-to-life and pro-choice people on the other side. So it's not the clear winning issue,\" Atkeson said. \"Abortion is in some ways an abstract issue for a lot of people that they're not going to face tomorrow.\"The outcome of the governor's race in New Mexico holds other national implications.A Ronchetti win would put Republicans back in the driver's seat on oilfield and climate regulations in the nation's No. 2 state for petroleum production. And Ronchetti has pledged to deploy troops and police to the U.S.-Mexico border, aligning enforcement with Republican-led initiatives in Texas and Arizona.The winner also will oversee a windfall in state government income linked to oil production, in a state with persistently high rates of childhood poverty and low-marks for public school performance. Lujan Grisham has urged voters to stay the course on increased public investments in education, health care and policing.She recently signed cuts on sales taxes and social security benefits. Ronchetti says he would go farther, including a permanent annual rebate tied to oilfield income for every individual in the state of 2.1 million residents.Republicans have spent heavily on turning the election into a referendum on crime and punishment.The Republican Governors Association has invested in TV ads that provide a frightening narrative around the release of a convicted felon who went on to slay his estranged girlfriend last year.Patty Lane, manager of a gallery of shops in Truth or Consequences, said Ronchetti's approach to crime, border security and the economy resonate in her community, and that she still resents aggressive pandemic health restrictions from Lujan Grisham that limited access to businesses while drawing down prison populations.\"Her handling of COVID, letting prisoners out that shouldn't be let out. ... Ronchetti, he just seems more level-headed,\" Lane said.Ronchetti, who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2020, said he'll appoint hard-nosed judges and has pledged to back police officers by restoring local immunity from prosecution to policing agencies, while railing against the state's pretrial release system. A voter-approved constitutional amendment in 2016 reduced the role of money-bail and made it harder to deny release while defendants await trial.New Mexico has alternated between Democratic and Republican governors since the early 1980s. An incumbent governor last lost reelection in 1994.The Democratic Party also seized on abortion access as a galvanizing issue in 2020 to oust several of the party's own incumbent state senators who had balked at overturning the state abortion ban -- clearing the way for 2021 legislation to preserve access.Since then, New Mexico has taken on an outsized roll in providing access to abortion for residents of neighboring states. Operators of the Mississippi clinic at the center of the court battle that overturned Roe v. Wade have opened a clinic in southern New Mexico.Ronchetti supports a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with limited exceptions, while advocating for a statewide referendum on whether to impose new restrictions.At the University of New Mexico, 19-year-old student Taylor Rittman said she was unlikely to support candidates who want to restrict access to abortion.\"It opens up the opportunity for the government to continue to take away freedoms\" from women, Rittman said.Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

(Photo by Christopher Smith/Invision/AP)This image released by Netflix shows Alejandro G. Inarritu, left, and Daniel Gimenez Cacho on the set of \"Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths.\" (Netflix via AP)In 2016, Alejandro G. Inarritu found himself walking up to the Oscars stage to pick up the best director award for the second time in two years. \"I can't believe this is happening,\" he said. With his consecutive wins for \"Birdman\" and \"The Revenant\" he had become one of only three directors, the others are John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, to do so and the first since 1950. If there is a peak in the movie making business, that might be it. But then, Inarritu disappeared -- at least from Hollywood features. He had some things to wrestle with, about himself, his art, his family, his country. That six years of introspection would bring him back to Mexico to make his first feature set there since his debut, \"Amores Perros,\" from 2000. \"I needed to find a little bit of peace and order in things that were manifesting in me emotionally,\" Inarritu said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"To shoot in Mexico was a consequence of the process that I went through. It was not the destination.\"The result, \"Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths,\" is a surreal journey into the subconscious of a journalist and documentary filmmaker, Silverio (Daniel Gimenez Cacho), who left Mexico City with his family some 20 years prior and found success in Los Angeles. As he tries to write a speech to accept a major honor in his adopted home country, he finds himself paralyzed by the weight of, well, everything, from Mexico's history to his anxieties about his art. The title plays into various meanings of bardo, as both a limbo between death and rebirth, in Buddhism, and bard in Spanish, and the film is a sprawling, droll dreamscape of emotion, family, home, identity and mythmaking. It opens in theaters in limited release Friday before hitting Netflix on Dec. 16.\"This is a story without a story,\" he said. \"It's a very different construction from anything that I have done.\"There are many parallels with Inarritu's life in Silverio's story. He also left Mexico 21 years ago and reached extraordinary heights in Los Angeles. In the film, a former colleague, one who stayed in Mexico, criticizes Silverio's work and life and skewers the hubris of artists. It is as though Inarritu is writing his own negative review about himself and it is just one of many dense scenes in which you can see the filmmaker dissecting himself. \"I included some thoughts that I have about myself,\" he said. \"And I can be harsher with myself than anybody else. Much harsher. I know what people think. And as (Silverio's wife) Lucia says to Silverio in the film, 'Sometimes we become what we think people think about us.'\"It was a humorously meta exercise, but it is important for Inarritu that people see also \"Bardo\" as fiction. It has to be. Autobiographies, for him, are only lies and hypocrisies. \"They claim truth and facts, but truth and facts do not exist,\" he said. \"Fiction is something that helps us to arrive to do a higher truth and reveals what the reality is hiding.\"Inarritu likes to say that he made \"Bardo\" with his eyes closed, looking inward to find a superior kind of reality or truth that is \"infinite, chaotic, contradictory and terrifying.\"The cast also had their eyes closed in a way. They didn't get to read the script prior to joining, but instead did extensive rehearsals starting six months before the shoot. By the time the cameras were rolling, they felt so at home in their characters and with their fellow actors that they could simply be present. For Ximena Lamadrid, who plays Silverio's grown daughter Camila, this process allowed her to separate from thinking too much about the big picture dream construct. \"I wasn't like, oh, we're part of this huge dream or this Silverio's conscience,\" Lamadrid said, \"I really felt and I still feel watching it, that my character, our characters, are based in truth.\"Her character is considering a return to Mexico, while her younger brother Lorenzo (Iker Sanchez Solano) questions his father's romanticism about Mexico and tells him that he feels more at home in the United States.\"When we started rehearsing and started to connect with each other, a lot of beautiful things came out. And those were really good tools to use when we were shooting,\" Solano said. \"The characters had some specific things that were actually going on in our personal lives. That was a really crazy coincidence.\"Many of the main players found themselves relating to and being affected by various threads and themes. One scene, in which Silverio is conversing with his dead father, had a deep impact on Cacho. He'd lost his own father over a decade prior but hadn't thought much about him until that moment. \"We were shooting and the presence of my father was suddenly there,\" Cacho said. \"When he died I just forgot about him. From that day to now, I've been having beautiful chats with him. This was very special for me.\"\"Bardo\" had its world premiere in competition at the Venice Film Festival earlier this fall. It was the first time Inarritu had seen it with more than a few people. Thousands saw it, and dozens of reviews were written off of the official festival cut. But, in that moment, watching it with 2,000 people, Inarritu made the bold decision to go back and re-edit the film before its theatrical and Netflix releases. \"Pain is temporary, but the film is forever,\" Inarritu said. \"I knew I was dealing with a situation, not a problem.\"The resulting film that will play in theaters and on Netflix is 22 minutes shorter, with some scenes cut entirely, others trimmed or replaced and an overall tightened focus on Silverio's family who are straddling two countries and two identities. And he's happy with it, whether it goes on to get Oscar recognition or not. \"It'll be interesting to see if this film really can touch the heart in a universal way. But there's nothing really we can do,\" Inarritu said. \"I have a friend that says this line that I like, which is 'low expectations, high serenity.' And that's how we are navigating this.\"---Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.GALLIANO, La. (AP) -- Three Louisiana men have been accused of distributing pills that killed a 15-year-old girl and hospitalized a 16-year-old boy, and more arrests are possible in what investigators believe is a fentanyl ring, a sheriff said Tuesday.Blayne Terrebonne, 18, of Larose, was arrested Thursday, the day deputies responded to a 4:30 a.m. report of the boy's apparent overdose and, hours later, to the girl's death at different homes in Galliano, Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release.Investigators believe both thought they were taking Percocet, a brand of oxycodone, said Capt. Brennan Matherne, a spokesperson for Webre.Sergio Perez, 18, of Cut Off, was arrested Thursday night and Anthony Francis, 21, of Larose, on Monday, Webre said.Each of the three was arrested on a charge of illegally distributing drugs. It was unknown if any of them had attorneys who could speak on their behalf.The sheriff's office released a photo from what investigators believe was a Snapchat ad for the drug, showing round blue pills imprinted with a capital M in a square, Matherne said. He said Percocet pills look similar but the fakes are more powdery and lack a dosage marking on the back.Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, can be 50 times as powerful as the same amount of heroin.Webre said the boy regained consciousnesses after two doses of Narcan and was taken to a hospital. \"When you use a drug you bought off the street, you are -- quite literally -- risking your life,\" Webre said. \"You are taking the word of a drug dealer on what the substance is. The question to ask yourself is whether the high you are seeking is worth dying over.\"Galliano is roughly 38 miles (61 kilometers) south of New Orleans, where the coroner reported in April that drug deaths last year were up 35 from 2020, and fentanyl was involved in nearly all of them.Opioids were involved in 1,384 deaths statewide last year compared with 982 in 2020, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. A graph in an August report indicated that nearly 1,000 deaths in 2021 involved fentanyl, with all synthetic opioids accounting for nearly 1,200 deaths.\"Deaths involving fentanyl have increased by greater than 2000 since 2014,\" the report stated.The sheriff said more charges are possible against the arrested men. He did not say what charges are being considered.Under Louisiana law, people can be charged with murder for distributing or dispensing an illegal drug that causes a death.To follow AP coverage of synthetic opioids, go to https://apnews.com/hub/synthetic-opioids.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.NEW YORK (AP) -- A longtime associate of Donald Trump purposely tried to mislead a jury about how he used his access to the former Republican president to secretly promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates, a prosecutor said Tuesday at a foreign influence trial.Tom Barrack \"was not being honest\" when he took the witness stand last week to deny he was provided confidential information to the UAE, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Harris said in closing arguments. \"He came into this courthouse and lied.\"Defense attorney Randall Jackson countered by telling jurors Barrack had no reason to lie because he had nothing to hide.\"This whole prosecution has been an act of misdirection,\" Jackson said. He added that prosecutors \"produced no evidence of a motive in this case - zero.\"Barrack, 75, is a longtime friend of Trump and California billionaire who chaired Trump's inaugural committee in 2017. He has pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, obstruction of justice and making false statements.Harris said that the evidence showed the defendant schemed to become the \"eyes, ears and the voice\" for the Emirates as part of a criminal conspiracy to manipulate Trump's foreign policy. At the same time. he leveraged his back-channel connections to get the UAE to pump tens of millions of dollars into an office building he was developing and into one of his investment funds, he added.The prosecutor pointed to what he characterized as a steady steam of shady texts and other communications that showed that Barrack was under the direction and control of Rashid al Malik, a businessman from the UAE who acted as a conduit to the rulers the oil-rich Persian Gulf state. Barrack \"marketed himself as politically connected. Someone who could open doors for the UAE. Someone who could offer access to Donald Trump. ... He was going to be their man on the inside,\" Harris said.Al Malik asked Barrack \"to do things for the UAE again and again,\" he said.Jackson said Barrack made no attempt to conceal his relationships with Al Malik or his network of business connections he had cultivated throughout the Middle East. He also said it \"makes no sense\" that his client would try to infiltrate the Trump campaign on the behalf of the UAE at a time when Trump's chances of winning the presidency were considered a longshot.\"He was involved in the campaign because he's loyal to his friends - maybe to a fault,\" the lawyer said. Last week, Barrack testified that \"dozens\" of people asked him for help in getting pardons from the former president. He also said he never sought a pardon for himself, even after he learned he was under investigation.Asked why, he responded, \"I never did anything wrong.\"Barrack, an Arabic speaker of Lebanese descent, also described efforts to arrange for Trump to meet with UAE national security advisor Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other officials from more moderate governments in an effort to persuade Trump to tone down his his anti-Muslim rhetoric.\"I was trying to get common ground, to try to get him to step back from what he didn't believe,\" he said.Jury deliberations are expected to begin on Wednesday.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

New athletic director John Cohen, whose hiring away from Mississippi State was announced hours after Harsin's firing, will be searching for a replacement coach.Harsin will receive a buyout of about 15.5 million from his 6-year, 31.5 million deal.Harsin said Auburn's resources and fan base give the Tigers \"the potential to be a championship program once again.\"\"Like any coach with the benefit of hindsight, there are things that could have been done differently,\" Harsin said. \"I don't pretend to be perfect but I am certain I will be better moving forward because of this experience.\"Former athletic director Allen Greene hired Harsin away from Boise State despite his lack of Southeastern Conference experience.Five players have recently announced intentions to enter the transfer portal, though reserve wide receiver Ze'Vian Capers was the first after Harsin's firing. Auburn has lost its last four games.AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

All Rights Reserved.Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Chase Claypool (11) warms up before an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Wide receiver Chase Claypool is heading to the Chicago Bears.A person with knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press the Pittsburgh Steelers have traded Claypool to Chicago for a second-round pick in the 2023 draft. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was not official.The trade gives Chicago quarterback Justin Fields a downfield threat in an effort to boost a passing attack that ranks last in the NFL, averaging just 126.9 yards per game.Claypool has 32 receptions for 301 yards and one touchdown this season for the Steelers (2-6). He also threw the first touchdown pass of his career in last week's loss to Philadelphia with a short flip to fullback Derek Watt on a gadget play.The 6-foot-4 Claypool, however, became expendable thanks to the emergence of rookie George Pickens. Pickens has quickly emerged as Pittsburgh's No. 2 receiver, bumping Claypool to third on the depth chart behind Pickens and Diontae Johnson.Claypool was a revelation in 2020 after being grabbed in the second round, scoring 10 touchdowns (eight receiving, two rushing) in his first 10 games while helping Pittsburgh get off to an 11-0 start on its way to the AFC North title.Replicating that production has proven difficult. Claypool has just four touchdowns in his past 29 games.The trade gives the rebuilding Steelers more capital in the 2023 draft to help out a group searching for a new identity in its first year without Ben Roethlisberger, who retired in January.Pittsburgh's 2-6 start is its worst since 2013. The defense has struggled without injured star linebacker T.J. Watt and the offense is sputtering behind rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett.Claypool gives Fields another talented -- if enigmatic -- target to help make the Bears more two-dimensional.AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband with a hammer told police he wanted to hold the Democratic leader hostage and \"break her kneecaps\" to show other members of Congress there were \"consequences to actions,\" authorities said Monday. (Oct 31) (AP Video by Terry Chea)SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The man accused of breaking into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home, beating her husband and seeking to kidnap her told police he was on a \"suicide mission\" and had plans to target other California and federal politicians, according to a Tuesday court filing.David DePape was ordered held without bail during his arraignment Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court. His public defender entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. It was his first public appearance since the early Friday attack.In the court filing, prosecutors detailed the attack in stark terms as part of their bid to keep DePape behind bars. Paul Pelosi was knocked unconscious by the hammer attack and woke up in a pool of his own blood, the filing said.DePape's intent \"could not have been clearer,\" San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins wrote in the filing: \"He forced his way into the Pelosi home intending to take the person third in line to the presidency of the United States hostage and to seriously harm her. Thwarted by Speaker Pelosi's absence, Defendant continued on his quest and would not be stopped, culminating in the near fatal attack on Mr. Pelosi.\"Without being questioned, DePape told officers and medics at the scene that he was sick of the \"lies coming out of Washington D.C.,\" the filing said. \"I didn't really want to hurt him, but you know this was a suicide mission. I'm not going to stand here and do nothing even if it cost me my life.\"DePape allegedly told first responders he had other targets, including a local professor as well as several prominent state and federal politicians and members of their families. The filing did not name any potential targets. \"This case demands detention,\" Jenkins wrote. \"Nothing less.\"Wearing orange jail clothing and with his right arm in a sling, DePape only spoke during his arraignment Tuesday to tell Judge Diane Northway how to pronounce his last name (dih-PAP').After the hearing, DePape's public defender Adam Lipson said he looks forward to providing him with a \"vigorous legal defense.\" He said his 42-year-old client's shoulder was dislocated during the arrest.\"We're going to be doing a comprehensive investigation of what happened. We're going to be looking into Mr. DePape's mental state, and I'm not going to talk any further about that until I have more information,\" Lipson said.He later said he was pleased that Paul Pelosi was improving and urged the public not to pass judgment on what he called \"a complicated situation.\"The attack on 82-year-old Paul Pelosi sent shockwaves through the political world just days before the hotly contested midterm elections. Threats against lawmakers and elections officials have been at all-time highs in this first nationwide election since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and authorities have issued warnings about rising extremism in the U.S.DePape faces state charges of attempted murder, burglary and elder abuse. He also faces federal charges including attempted kidnapping of a U.S. official. While prosecutors have not offered a timeline prior to Friday's events, Jenkins previously told The Associated Press that the attack appeared premeditated.\"This was not something that he did at the spur of the moment,\" she told the AP on Monday. The court filing said DePape smashed his shoulder through a glass window early Friday in the back of the Pelosis' Pacific Heights home and confronted a sleeping Paul Pelosi, clad only in boxer shorts and a pajama top. \"Are you Paul Pelosi?\" DePape said, standing over him around 2 a.m. holding a hammer and zip ties. \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\"A groggy Pelosi told DePape that his wife was not home and would be gone for several days. DePape then allegedly threatened to tie Paul Pelosi up -- the first of 10 such threats, the filing says.Paul Pelosi was eventually able to call 911 from the home's bathroom, where his cellphone was charging. While speaking to the dispatcher, DePape was gesturing and telling Pelosi to hang up, the filing said. Pelosi then told the dispatcher that he did not need police, fire or medical assistance but he instead asked \"for the Capitol Police because they are usually at the house protecting his wife.\" Moments later the dispatcher heard him interacting with a man and Paul Pelosi said \"Uh, he thinks everything's good. Uh, I've got a problem, but he thinks everything's good.\"Two officers who raced to the home witnessed DePape hit Pelosi with the hammer at least once, striking him in the head, the filing states. Jenkins has said the assault was captured on the officers' body cameras.Speaker Pelosi was in Washington at the time and under the protection of her security detail, which does not extend to family members. She quickly returned to San Francisco, where her husband was hospitalized and underwent surgery for a skull fracture and other injuries. In Washington, U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger provided a sobering update Tuesday of security protocols for members of Congress.Manger said that although many improvements have been made since the Capitol attack, including the hiring of nearly 280 officers by the end of this year, \"there is still a lot of work to do.\"\"We believe today's political climate calls for more resources to provide additional layers of physical security for members of Congress,\" he said.

(AP) -- A retired Massachusetts state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism, and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery.A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester.Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday's ceremony.\"Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,\" Baker said in a statement.Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed anti-Semitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.Although retired law enforcement officers do not meet the Hanna Award criteria, the committee that selects the recipients unanimously agreed that Green epitomized exceptional bravery and disregard for his safety in the face of grave danger.Worcester Police Officer Enmanuel Familia was one of several city officers who were honored for their efforts to save drowning teens at Green Hill Park in June 2021.

Roy Cooper speaks while former University of North Carolina system presidents Tom Ross, left, and Margaret Spellings listen at a news conference at the Executive Mansion in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Cooper announced that Ross and Spellings would co-chair a Commission on the Future of Public Universities that would look in part and changing the governing structure of the university system and its 17 member schools. (AP Photo/Gary D. Robertson)RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender.The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country's leading public university systems -- with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. \"The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,\" Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. \"But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few ... we have an appointed university leadership that doesn't come close to reflecting our diversity.\" As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system's stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members. \"Our public universities, especially, must be places where every person feels welcome, heard and represented,\" said Spellings, system president from 2016 to 2019 and a U.S. education secretary under President George W. Bush. \"We must leave our unique self-interests -- be they political, geographic or institutional -- at the door and we must be what I call organized for success.\"For 50 years, the legislature has chosen the voting members of the system Board of Governors -- half elected by the House and the other half by the Senate. The board's membership was dropped recently from 32 to 24. Critics have complained that representation by racial minorities and women on the Board of Governors falls short. \"We know the way university leaders are chosen must expand to reflect more of who we are,\" said Cooper, who earned undergraduate and law degrees from UNC-Chapel Hill. \"The system needs reform.\"Legislative officials were immediately cool to the commission's work, which Cooper wants completed before the General Assembly's chief work session concludes next year. Lawmakers would have to approve significant changes for them to be implemented. The legislature likely will remain in GOP hands for the next two years after next week's elections. \"Governance of higher education is constitutionally placed with the General Assembly,\" Neal Inman, chief of staff to House Speaker Tim Moore, wrote in an email. \"There is no interest in changing the structure of the UNC system, regardless of whatever report this politically-motivated commission produces.\" Republicans exercised their political might in the 2010s after they took control of both the state House and Senate by filling the board with like-minded members. And weeks before Cooper was sworn in as governor in early 2017, the legislature passed a law eliminating Cooper's ability to appoint some campus trustee board members and giving those choices to legislative leaders.Cooper's executive order creating the commission envisions at least 15 members.The governor said potential solutions could be to create board slots that are designated for the minority party at the General Assembly, or to give appointments to a broader swath of officials, such as community college leaders or the superintendent of public instruction. A 2001 lawsuit led the Democratic-controlled legislature to remove board membership quotas for racial minorities, women and members of the General Assembly's minority party. If the commission recommends giving some appointment powers to the governor, Cooper said he'd ask that they wouldn't take effect until after he leaves office in January 2025. But Senate leader Phil Berger said later Tuesday that \"you'd have to be naive to think the purpose of this 'commission' is to do anything other than recommend the governor obtain partisan appointments to university boards.\"Ross, a former judge, Davidson College president and head of the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, was hired as system president in 2011 and announced his departure in 2015.At the time of her announced departure as president, Spellings acknowledged conflicts with Republican board members made it the right time to leave. The board didn't like some of her hiring decisions to lead individual campuses nor the system's response to protests demanding the removal of a Confederate soldier statue on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus that was ultimately torn down by a crowd in 2018.UNC-Chapel Hill's trustee board also faced bad publicity in a 2021 tenure dispute with journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, who won the Pulitzer Prize for her work on the 1619 Project. Cooper didn't pin problems on current President Peter Hans, saying \"he's doing a good job, particularly under the circumstances.\"Hans said in a written statement: \"Disagreements over policy and governance are a fact of life, and we welcome public interest and accountability, as the University of North Carolina's fundamentals have never been stronger.\" Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - This undated photo provided by the Alexandria, Va., Sheriff's Office in January 2022 shows Allison Fluke-Ekren. Fluke-Ekren, a Kansas native convicted of leading an all-female battalion of the Islamic State group, had a long history of behavior that included sexual and physical abuse of her own children, family members said in court filings Oct. 19, 2022. (Alexandria Sheriff's Office via AP, File)ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A Kansas native who led an all-female Islamic State battalion when she lived in Syria has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, the maximum possible sentence, after her own children denounced her in court and detailed the horrific circumstances and abuse she heaped on them. Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, admitted that she led the Khatiba Nusaybah, a battalion in which roughly 100 women and girls -- some as young as 10 years old -- learned how to use automatic weapons and detonate grenades and suicide belts.One of Fluke-Ekren's daughters was among those who said she received such training. The daughter and Fluke-Ekren's oldest son, now adults, both urged the judge to impose the maximum sentence.They said they were physically and sexually abused by their mother, and described the mistreatment in detail in letters to the court. Fluke-Ekren denied the abuse.The daughter, Leyla Ekren, said \"lust for control and power\" drove her mother to drag the family half way across the world to find a terrorist group that would allow Fluke-Ekren to flourish, during a victim impact statement she gave at the hearing.She said her mother became skilled at hiding the abuse she inflicted. She described a circumstance where her mother poured an off-brand lice medication all over her face as a punishment and it started to blister her face and burn her eyes. Fluke-Ekren then tried to wash the chemicals off her daughers's face, but Leyla Ekren resisted.\"I wanted people to see what kind of person she was. I wanted it to blind me,\" she said as her mother sat a few feet away, resting her head on her hand with a look of disbelief. After her children testified, she glared in their direction.Fluke-Ekren's status as a U.S.-born woman who rose to a leadership status in the Islamic State makes her story unique among terror cases. Prosecutors say the abuse she inflicted on her children from a young age helps explain how she went from an 81-acre (33-hectare) farm in Overbrook, Kansas, to an Islamic State leader in Syria, with stops in Egypt and Libya along the way. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh said Fluke-Ekren's family sent her to an elite private school in Topeka and that she grew up in a stable home. Parekh said Fluke-Ekren's immediate family was unanimous in its desire to see her punished to the maximum extent possible, a circumstance the veteran prosecutor described as extremely rare. \"There is nothing in Fluke-Ekren's background that can explain her conduct, which was driven by fanaticism, power, manipulation, delusional invincibility, and extreme cruelty,\" Parekh said. Fluke-Ekren asked for just a two-year sentence so she could raise her young children. She said at the outset of a lengthy, weepy speech that she takes responsibility for her actions before rationalizing and minimizing her conduct.\"We just lived a very normal life,\" she told the judge about her time in Syria, showing pictures of her kids at a weekly pizza dinner.She denied the abuse allegations, and tried to accuse her oldest son of manipulating her daughter into making them.She portrayed the Khatiba Nusaybah as something more akin to a community center for women that morphed into a series of self-defense classes as it became clear that the city of Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold where she lived, faced invasion.She acknowledged that women and girls were taught to use suicide belts and automatic weapons but portrayed it as safety training to avoid accidents in a war zone where such weapons were common.Judge Leonie Brinkema, though, made clear she was unimpressed by Fluke-Ekren's justifications. At one point, Fluke-Ekren explained the need for women to defend themselves against the possibility of rape by enemy soldiers. \"Sexual violence is not OK in any circumstance,\" she said.Brinkema interrupted to ask Fluke-Ekren about the daughter's allegation that she was forced to marry an Islamic State fighter who raped her at the age of 13.\"She was a few weeks away from 14,\" Fluke-Ekren responded in protest, later saying, \"It was her decision. I never forced her.\"Parekh described Fluke-Ekren as an \"empress of ISIS\" whose husbands rose to senior ranks in the Islamic State, often to be killed in fighting. Even within the Islamic State, people who knew Fluke-Ekren described her radicalization as \"off the charts\" and other terrorist groups refused her plans to form a female battalion until she finally found a taker in the Islamic State, Parekh said.Fluke-Ekren's actions \"added a new dimension to the darkest side of humanity,\" Parekh said.In addition to forming the battalion, Fluke-Ekren admitted that while living in Libya, she helped translate, review and summarize documents taken from U.S. diplomatic facilities after the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi. The spelling of Leyla Ekren's first name has been corrected.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File)THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor sought Tuesday to reopen his investigation into allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by Venezuelan security forces under President Nicolas Maduro's rule.Prosecutor Karim Khan's request for authorization to resume the probe comes just over six months after Venezuela asked the court to defer its investigation to authorities in the Latin American nation.The ICC is a court of last resort that investigates alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave offenses when nations are unable, or unwilling, to do so -- a system known as complementarity.But Khan said Tuesday that \"I have concluded that the deferral requested by Venezuela is, at this stage, not warranted, and that the investigation should be authorized to resume.\"He acknowledged that Venezuelan authorities have launched legal reforms, but said that they currently \"remain either insufficient in scope or have not yet had any concrete impact on potentially relevant proceedings.\"The case was brought to the court by member states Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru, who sought an investigation into alleged crimes since early 2014.Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, conducted a preliminary probe and in 2020 said she found a reasonable basis to conclude that crimes against humanity had been committed in Venezuela, since at least April 2017. The preliminary examination focused mainly on allegations of excessive force, arbitrary detention and torture by security forces during a crackdown on antigovernment protests in 2017.Khan subsequently opened his investigation in November last year -- the first by the court in Latin America -- saying he and his team would \"do our work independently and devoid of any political agenda.\"Khan commended Maduro's government \"for its constructive engagement\" with the court and said it is now up to judges to decide on Venezuela's deferral request and his application to resume his investigation.\"Irrespective of the outcome, I remain committed to engagement and dialogue to explore ways in which we can cooperate to ensure justice for victims in Venezuela,\" he added.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- West Virginia running back CJ Donaldson will miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery, coach Neal Brown said Tuesday.Brown didn't specify the type of injury to Donaldson, who hurt his lower leg in a 41-31 loss to No. 7 TCU on Saturday. It was the second time the 240-pound freshman was injured this season.Donaldson went into the concussion protocol after a loss at Texas on Oct. 1. He sat out a win over Baylor on Oct. 13, then returned the following week at Texas Tech. Donaldson had four 100-yard rushing games this season. He has a team-high 526 yards with eight touchdowns.West Virginia's backfield is already thin. Tony Mathis sat out the TCU game and his status for this week remains to be determined. Backup Justin Johnson has been banged up and Brown hopes he can play.

The Supreme Court has lifted a temporary hold on Graham's testimony in a Georgia investigation of possible illegal interference in the 2020 election by then-President Donald Trump and his allies in the state. The high court on Nov. 1, 2022, left no legal impediments in the way of Graham's appearance before a special grand jury, now scheduled for Nov. 17. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for Sen. Lindsey Graham's testimony in a Georgia investigation of possible illegal interference in the 2020 election by then-President Donald Trump and his allies in the state.The court lifted a temporary hold on Graham's appearance before a special grand jury, now scheduled for Nov. 17.But in an unsigned order, the justices noted that Graham still could raise objections to some questions.\"Today, the Supreme Court confirmed that the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause applies here. They also affirmed that Senator Graham may return to the District Court if the District Attorney tries to ask questions about his constitutionally protected activities. The Senator's legal team intends to engage with the District Attorney s office on next steps to ensure respect for this constitutional immunity.\"The South Carolina senator, a top Trump ally, had argued that a provision of the Constitution, the speech and debate clause, shields him from being forced to testify at all.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had told the justices that \"the delay resulting from a stay would be unavoidably harmful\" to the grand jury investigation.Lower courts had rebuffed Graham's plea for a pause while the legal case plays out.Tuesday's order dissolved a temporary hold that Justice Clarence Thomas had placed on the testimony while he and his colleagues weighed the arguments. Graham's legal team plans to reach out to Willis' office about what happens next, according to a statement from the senator's office.Graham, a four-term senator who last won reelection in 2020, was first subpoenaed in July by Willis. The district attorney opened her investigation shortly after a recording of a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was made public. In that call, Trump suggested Raffensperger could \"find\" the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Willis wants to question Graham about two phone calls he made to Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election.During those calls, Graham asked about \"reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,\" Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony.Graham also \"made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,\" she wrote. She said in a hearing last month that Graham may be able to provide insight into the extent of any coordinated efforts to influence the results.Raffensperger said he took Graham's question about absentee ballots as a suggestion to toss out legally cast votes. Graham has dismissed that interpretation as \"ridiculous.\" Graham has also argued that the call was protected because he was asking questions to inform his decisions on voting to certify the 2020 election and future legislation.Lower courts already have told Willis that she \"may not ask about any investigatory conduct,\" which is protected under the Constitution.The justices wrote Tuesday that their intervention is unnecessary because the courts \"have held that Senator Graham may not be questioned about such activities.\"He also can return to federal court if disputes arise over the questioning in front of the grand jury, the justices wrote.Thomas initially dealt with Graham's appeal, but involved the rest of the court in Tuesday's order, as is customary.But Thomas did not step aside from the case, and indeed he has participated in all the election-related disputes brought to the court by Trump and his allies, despite the involvement of the justice's wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, in efforts to question Trump's defeat in 2020.Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and staunch Trump supporter, attended the Jan. 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally on the Ellipse and wrote to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks following the election, encouraging him to work to overturn President Joe Biden's victory and keep Trump in office.She also contacted lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election, though no evidence has emerged that she contacted Georgia officials. Ginni Thomas was recently interviewed by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, and she stood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent, despite the fact that numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump's own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of mass fraud.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)Nebraska U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse won approval Tuesday from the University of Florida Board of Trustees to be the school's next president despite vocal opposition from some faculty and students.Sasse, a Republican, was recommended for the top post by a unanimous vote of the trustees. A final vote to elevate Sasse as the school's 13th president is set for Nov. 10 by the state university system Board of Governors.The recommended compensation package for Sasse comes to about 1.6 million, university officials said. That will also be finalized at the governors meeting.During a four-hour meeting Tuesday on the Gainesville campus, Sasse sought to allay concerns that he's more a creature of politics than academia by saying he will take a \"pledge of political celibacy\" with regard to partisan issues.\"I would have no activity in partisan politics in any way as I arrive at the University of Florida,\" Sasse said, adding that his candidacy was not pushed by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Florida elected officials. \"There is just tons and tons of learning and listening that I need to do.\"Opposition to Sasse, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014, has focused on his stance against same-sex marriage and positions on other LGBTQ issues. Some faculty and students question his qualifications to run such a sprawling school with more than 50,000 students. leading to a recent no-confidence vote by the university's faculty Senate. Sasse, a historian by training with a doctorate from Yale University, was previously president of Midland University in Fremont, Nebraska, which has just over 1,600 students. He also taught at the University of Texas.\"I want to ask, senator: Why are you here?\" freshman student Nathaniel Pelton asked at the meeting, which drew several dozen protesters outside. \"I don't want any politician to be my president. I want someone who cares about my community.\"Sasse, 50, said he does not foresee changes in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said LGBTQ students and faculty will be treated with \"dignity and respect,\" just like anyone else on campus.\"Communities of ideas are built on respect and trust,\" Sasse said. \"Everybody is created with infinite worth.\"Still, some students are skeptical and want assurances that Sasse will keep his promises of political neutrality, said Lauren Lemasters, the university student body president.\"There is this hill of trust that is going to have to be climbed by you,\" she said.Sasse also said he strongly supports faculty tenure and academic freedom so that there is a robust exchange of all ideas on campus. And despite his strong criticism of the communist Chinese government, Sasse said students and faculty from China should feel welcome.\"We want the best faculty to stay at this place and to be recruited to this place, and that requires academic freedom,\" he said. \"We want more and all students from every background.\"Much criticism of Sasse's choice centered on a new selection process in which all candidates remained anonymous until only the single finalist's identity was revealed. Mori Hosseini, the trustees' chairman, said almost none of the most qualified candidates would have pursued the job had the process been public.\"I can tell you for a fact none of the top 12 we considered would have moved past the initial conversation with us.\" Hosseini said. \"It's that simple.\"Sasse would resign his Senate seat if he wins final approval as the university's president. The Republican governor of Nebraska would appoint a replacement to finish the four years remaining on his second term.Sasse will replace Kent Fuchs, who has been Florida's president since 2015 and has overseen the school's rising academic reputation among public universities nationally.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Scientists said Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022 that the invasive mosquito species Anopheles stephensi was likely responsible for a large outbreak of malaria in Ethiopia earlier this year, a finding that one expert called a worrying sign that progress against the disease is at risk of unraveling. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty, File)LONDON (AP) -- Scientists say an invasive mosquito species was likely responsible for a large malaria outbreak in Ethiopia earlier this year, a finding that experts called a worrying sign that progress against the disease is at risk of unraveling.The mosquito species, known as Anopheles stephensi, has mostly been seen in India and the Persian Gulf. In 2012, it was discovered in Djibouti and it has since been found in Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria. The mosquitoes are suspected to be behind a recent rise in malaria in Djibouti, prompting the World Health Organization to try to stop the insects from spreading further in Africa.On Tuesday, malaria scientist Fitsum Tadesse presented research at a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine in Seattle, suggesting that the invasive mosquitoes were also responsible for an outbreak in Ethiopia.In January, health officials in Dire Dawa, a major transportation hub, reported a rapid rise in malaria. Tadesse, lead scientist at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, jumped in with his team to investigate. They tracked more than 200 malaria cases, examined nearby mosquito sites and tested invasive mosquitoes for the malaria parasite. They didn't find many of the mosquitoes that usually spread malaria in Africa. Instead, they found high densities of the invasive mosquitoes. Tadesse and colleagues concluded the invasive mosquitoes were \"strongly linked\" to the outbreak.\"This new evidence is terrifying,\" said Thomas Churcher, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, who was not connected to the research. He said most malaria spread in Africa has been in rural areas, as native mosquitoes don't usually like breeding in polluted cities or artificial containers like buckets. But the invasive mosquitoes can thrive in such conditions. \"If these mosquitoes get a toehold in Africa, it could be phenomenally bad,\" he said. The main mosquito-control measures used in Africa -- like bed nets and indoor spraying -- aren't likely to work against the invasive bugs, since they tend to bite people outdoors.Still, Churcher said patchy surveillance means scientists don't know how common the invasive mosquitoes are or how much malaria they're causing. Ethiopian malaria researcher Aklilu Getnet said officials have seen a major rise in the disease this year. He blamed longer rainy seasons and the conflict in northern Ethiopia, which has drained resources away from malaria. \"We are very worried,\" he said, saying that until recently, Ethiopia had seen a big drop in malaria. \"What we are seeing now is a significant increase.\"Anne Wilson, an infectious diseases expert at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said African communities might consider adapting measures used in India to fight the mosquitoes, like introducing fish that eat the larvae or prohibiting containers with standing water. She said slowing progress against malaria is further complicating efforts to stop the parasitic disease, which is estimated to kill more than 600,000 people every year, mostly in Africa. \"We're waiting to see the impact of new tools like pesticides and vaccines,\" she said. \"But if this mosquito starts to take off, we may be out of time.\"The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(AP Photo/Mike Carlson, File)FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Ian not only ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed man-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography.Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the coast of southwest Florida.\"The one-time vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,\" said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. \"Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.\"Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of around 13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\"Time will tell how this affects our greater economy, because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,\" Johnson said.The marine researchers on the cruise found high counts of the naturally-occurring algae that causes red tide offshore Punta Gorda, Boca Grande and southwest of Sanibel Island. It will be several weeks before researchers can analyze water samples that were collected to determine the threat to sea life off the Florida coast.The red tide outbreak also is threatening manatees off Sarasota and Charlotte counties that rely on seagrass for food, according to the Ocean Conservancy.\"Florida is at a crossroads, with a record number of manatees dying,\" said J.P. Brooker, director of Florida conservation for the Ocean Conservancy. \"We must keep this issue at the forefront, so leaders statewide will invest in solutions to improve water quality--protecting natural habitats to save our beloved manatees.\"Through mid-October, there have been 719 manatee deaths recorded by Florida wildlife officials.

(AP Photo/Brett Davis, File)Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker (5) throws to a receiver during the first half of an NCAA college football game against the Tennessee Martin Saturday, Oct. 22, 2022, in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Wade Payne)Just in time for its biggest test of the season against No. 2 Tennessee's top-ranked offense, top-ranked Georgia's defense has lost outside linebacker Nolan Smith to a season-ending injury.Smith, who leads Georgia with three sacks and is fifth with 18 tackles, suffered a torn right pectoral muscle in last week's 42-20 win over Florida. Georgia announced Tuesday that Smith, a senior, will have surgery on Thursday and is expected to make a full recovery.Smith was one of only three returning starters from the 2021 defense that led Georgia to its first national championship since 1980. Despite having eight players from the defense selected in this year's draft, including five in the first round, Georgia (8-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 3 College Football Playoff) is second in the nation with its average of 10.50 points allowed.Georgia coach Kirby Smart said after Tuesday's practice Smith \"has great energy right now\" and has continued to lead.\"I talked to him and asked to help left spirits and push,\" Smart said. \"That has been his role when he is practicing, so I don't want him to change now that he is not. He is out there flying around and helping us out. It is great to have him take that on. Not all kids do that. Sometimes you get dejected or down in the dumps. He is not like that.\"Saturday's matchup provides the opportunity for Georgia to prove it again has a championship-caliber defense. Tennessee (8-0, 4-0, No. 1 CFP), tied with Ohio State for No. 2 in the AP poll, leads the nation with its average of 49.4 points per game.Senior Robert Beal and sophomore Chaz Chambliss, who already have played significant roles, played more snaps after Smith's injury last week. Chambliss said the expectation is to regroup after losing Smith to the injury just as the defense reloaded after losing eight players in the draft.\"We didn't drop because it's the standard here,\" Chambliss said. \"The defense has a standard that we're going to be the best of the best and it doesn't change by who's here or how many draft picks; it's just the standard here to have a great defense. We practice like that every single day and that's why we haven't dropped off.\"The loss of Smith adds difficulty to the already daunting challenge of containing the Vols' fast-paced attack led by quarterback Hendon Hooker. Tennessee leads the nation in total offense and ranks second in passing.Hooker passed for three touchdowns and ran for a score in Tennessee's 44-6 win over then-No. 19 Kentucky last week.The win over Kentucky was the Vols' best defensive game of the season, but the spotlight will rest on the matchup between Tennessee's offense and Georgia's defense.The Bulldogs' secondary will be challenged to contain Tennessee's wide receivers, including Jalin Hyatt, who has set a school record with 14 TD catches, including two against Kentucky. The secondary is led by cornerback Kelee Ringo and safety Christopher Smith.\"One thing is for sure, they're going to get to cover,\" Smart said of his defensive backs. \"They're going to find out. Because there's no hiding anybody when you play these guys.\"Cedric Tillman, the Vols' top wide receiver last season, returned last week in a limited role after missing much of the season with a high ankle sprain. Tillman could play a bigger role against Georgia.When asked what makes the Tennessee receivers so difficult to cover, Smart said: \"Speed, space, scheme, talented arm.\" \"You know, you can have the best receivers in the world, and they get open all the time, if you don't have somebody that can get it to them -- they have somebody that can protect them and get it to him,\" Smart said. \"They do a good job of that. Again, that's the challenge for us this week.\"The winner of Saturday's game will take command of the SEC Eastern Division race for a spot in the SEC championship game.Hooker said the showdown represents \"the top brand of football.\"\"As you can see, they have some great coaches behind them, and they play extremely hard,\" Hooker said Monday when asked about Georgia's defense. \"That's something that you can't teach. The effort and attitude and toughness that they bring to the game is immaculate and that's what SEC football is about.\" AP Sports Writer Teresa M.

With the gift from Scott, the agency plans to expand its programs aimed at securing economic self-reliance and civil rights for underserved communities, the organization's president and CEO, Judy Reese Morse, said in a statement Monday.\"So often the work of black-led, community-serving organizations goes unnoticed and under-resourced,\" she said. \"Ms. Scott's spirit and conviction to address historic disparities by supporting organizations that prioritize and engage the community inspires us to remain unwavering in our commitment to deliver even more for black and other underserved communities in Louisiana.\"Morse said Scott's gift would be \"transformational.\"With a net worth estimated at over 30 billion by Forbes, Scott is one of the wealthiest people in the world.

An appeals court will hear arguments in a case that might determine when New York elections officials count absentee ballots. Lawyers for the state are seeking to overturn a lower court decision declaring a state law that allowed early review of those ballots before Election Day unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A New York appeals court on Tuesday upheld a new state law allowing absentee ballots to be reviewed before Election Day, saying it would would be \"extremely disruptive\" to change the rules with absentee voting already underway.The decision from the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court reverses a lower court ruling that declared New York's early review of absentee ballots unconstitutional. The appeals court said Republican and Conservative party officials who challenged the law waited too long.The court also upheld a pandemic-era law that allows voters worried about becoming ill to vote by absentee.\"In our view, granting petitioners the requested relief during an ongoing election would be extremely disruptive and profoundly destabilizing and prejudicial to candidates, voters and the State and local Boards of Elections,\" read a decision from the court, which had heard arguments in the case earlier Tuesday.Election Day is Nov. 8. About 552,000 absentee ballots have been sent out with more than 188,000 returned so far, according to the state Board of Elections.Changing the absentee ballot rules now would mean voters would be treated differently during this election depending on when they returned their ballots, the court said.\"We should be taking every step possible to empower voters and ease New Yorkers' access to the polls,\" state Attorney General Letitia James said in a prepared release. \"I was proud to defend New York's absentee ballot reforms, and am happy with the decision to keep these commonsense election integrity initiatives in place.\"It was not clear if the plaintiffs would try to appeal to the state's highest court.An email seeking comment on the decision was sent to a state Republican spokesperson.Processing of absentee ballots as they come in -- as opposed to waiting until election night -- was adopted to reduce sometimes weekslong delays for official results.But early absentee ballot processing was thrown in limbo last month after the ruling by Saratoga County Judge Diane Freestone. She said the law clashes with an individual's constitutional right to challenge ballots in court before they're counted.The mid-level appeals court put a temporary hold on Freestone's order pausing the count after the Democrats in control of state government appealed. Absentee ballots are currently being processed around the state, after some reluctance by GOP election officials.At arguments earlier Tuesday, lawyers for the Republican plaintiffs told the five-judge panel that Freestone's ruling was correct and that the new law removes a crucial later of judicial review.\"We have a statute that is expedient. It sacrifices accuracy; it sacrifices the truth,\" attorney John Ciampoli told the judges. The early review challenge was bought in late September, about nine months after the law was enacted. Judges asked plaintiffs' attorneys why they waited until it was close to the Nov. 8 election to challenge it.\"Where have you been?\" Justice John Egan asked Ciampoli. \"Here we are a week before the election. There's a whole lot of absentee ballots that have been cast by now.\"Lawyers for the state and their allies argued against changing the rules after absentee balloting has begun.\"The New York Constitution protects the right to vote, not the right of private parties to challenge the qualified votes of others,\" said Aria Branch, who is representing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other parties.Sarah Rosenbluth of the state attorney general's office said the action should have been bought much earlier, and that now the lower court ruling has thrown the canvassing process in disarray.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The Trump Organization is on trial this week for criminal tax fraud. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's election as president was a wake-up call -- not just for the political establishment, but also for the company synonymous with him, his wealth and his fame, a top executive testified Tuesday.Suddenly, with the boss heading to the White House in 2017, the Trump Organization found itself scrambling to scrub some pay practices and financial arrangements now at issue at the company's criminal tax fraud trial in New York, senior vice president and controller Jeffrey McConney told jurors.The Trump Organization changed its ways in 2017 or 2018 after bringing in a Washington lawyer to audit its tax practices following Trump's election, McConney said in his second day on the witness stand before testing positive for COVID-19, a development that abruptly suspended the trial until Monday.The company, which for years lavished perks on some top executives, now stands accused of helping them avoid income taxes on those extras, including a Manhattan apartment and luxury cars. McConney, who coughed at times during his testimony, told jurors he fudged company pay records to reduce longtime company finance chief Allen Weisselberg's income tax bill.After the audit, \"I was instructed at certain points to do things differently,\" McConney said.The tax fraud case is the only criminal trial that has arisen from the Manhattan district attorney's three-year investigation of the former president.It is one of three active cases involving Trump or the company in New York courts. They are also defendants in a fraud lawsuit filed by the state's attorney general and a lawsuit brought by protesters who say they were roughed up by Trump's security guards.Trump was elected president in November 2016 and took office in January 2017, inviting fresh scrutiny of the Trump Organization, a privately held entity through which he and his family manage its golf courses, luxury towers and other investments.After Trump's election, McConney said, the Trump Organization asked tax lawyer Sheri Dillon to conduct an investigation of the tax practices at its various entities. Dillon, who consulted for the company on various tax matters over the years, wrote a lengthy memo detailing her findings, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.McConney said he never saw the memo, and company lawyers cut off further discussion with a sustained objection, citing attorney-client privilege. Nevertheless, McConney said, the company changed its tax and pay practices soon after the audit.\"When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, these companies finally had to clean up these fraudulent tax practices,\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger said, previewing McConney's testimony in her opening statement Monday.Weisselberg has pleaded guilty to taking 1.7 million in off-the-books compensation and agreed to testify as a prosecution witness at the trial, likely next week, in exchange for a five-month jail sentence.The company paid for a Manhattan apartment and Mercedes-Benz cars for Weisselberg and his wife, as well as parking spots, utilities and furnishings, with one receipt noting the order was, \"VIP FOR TRUMP.\" Weisselberg's son and another Trump Organization executive also received off-the-books compensation, prosecutors said.Neither Trump nor any of his children who have worked as Trump Organization executives are charged or accused of wrongdoing.McConney, who was granted immunity to testify last year before a grand jury and again to testify at the criminal trial, said that Trump was the Trump Organization's ultimate decision-maker prior to his election.Trump signed off on Weisselberg's salary and bonuses, signed a lease for the Manhattan apartment the Trump Organization rented for Weisselberg and his wife, and personally paid the tuition for Weisselberg's grandchildren to attend the prestigious Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School.\"He was the boss,\" McConney said.Some checks and documents bearing Trump's distinct signature were shown in court, along with pay statements and other documents detailing some of the company's since-altered compensation practices.Steinglass projected receipts onto a large screen across from the jury box detailing how much the company was paying for Weisselberg's perks -- at one point, 6,500 per month for apartment rent, 286.95 for cable TV, and thousands of dollars in cash for him to hand out as tips at Christmastime.Jurors were also shown documents illustrating how McConney changed Weisselberg's pay records, trimming his salary and bonus by more than 195,000 in one year to reflect the amount the company and Trump had spent on rent and tuition.McConney said Weisselberg instructed him to make the changes because he was \"appreciative that the president was paying these bills on his behalf and he believed that his compensation should be reduced.\"But the fuzzy math wasn't just out of the kindness of Weisselberg's heart; it allowed Weisselberg to \"essentially to pay his rent with pre-tax dollars ... the same with the tuition for his grandchildren ... his utilities ... his car,\" Steinglass said.After Trump became president, his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, took over day-to-day control of the company. Donald Trump Jr. signed a tuition check for Weisselberg's grandchildren in January 2017, Steinglass said.As for Trump's current status with the company, McConney said he wasn't sure.\"I haven't dealt with him since he's come out of office, so I don't know what he does for the company now,\" McConney said.Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak.

(AP) -- A man pretended to be a student and lived in several Stanford University dorms for at least 10 months, a university official said Tuesday.The university's Department of Public Safety cited the man for violating the law the first time he was found living in a dorm in December 2021, but that didn't deter him, Stanford spokeswoman Dee Mostofi said in a statement. Since then, campus police officers have obtained multiple stay-away letters, a prerequisite to citing someone for trespass on campus, but they weren't able to locate the man until last Thursday, when they gave him a stay-away letter and removed him from campus, Mostofi said. She said the university has protocols and policies to prevent non-students from entering and living in the dorms, but that the man's \"persistence and ability to ingratiate himself with our student community has made it clear that gaps exist in those protocols.\" Some staff in individual dorms were notified of the man's presence, but \"there were no broad communications about him to all Stanford residences,\" Mostofi said.She said the university will review its procedures to prevent such an incident from happening again.Mostofi didn't provide any other information or answer questions emailed to her. The Stanford Daily reported Monday that the man had been living in a dorm's basement when police found him last week and that he had lived in at least five dorms. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn)SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers traded running back Jeff Wilson Jr. to the Miami Dolphins for a fifth-round pick on Tuesday.The Niners had a surplus at running back after trading for Christian McCaffrey last month and with Week 1 starter Elijah Mitchell expected to return after the bye week from a knee injury.So they managed to recoup a draft pick after trading away four of them for McCaffrey and reunited Wilson with Miami coach Mike McDaniel, who had been in charge of the running game in San Francisco for Wilson's first four seasons in the NFL.\"At some point, you can only keep so many, just from a roster approach,\" general manager John Lynch said. \"Like we knew when we made the Christian move, somebody was going to have to go, and, ultimately, Jeff's the one that somebody made a move that we felt was worth moving on and we did.\"Wilson will team with former 49ers teammate Raheem Mostert in Miami's backfield after the Dolphins traded Chase Edmonds in a package to Denver earlier Tuesday for pass rusher Bradley Chubb.Wilson has been a productive back when given the opportunity to play since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2018. He led the Niners in rushing with 600 yards in 2020 and had 92 carries for a team-high 468 yards and two TDs this year.Wilson has averaged 84.1 yards from scrimmage in his 18 career starts in San Francisco.But the Niners were going to have a hard time getting him the ball now that McCaffrey and Mitchell are both available. Lynch said Wilson came to management and expressed a desire to play someplace where he could have an impact and the deal with Miami came together. \"We assured him how much we valued him, but if all those things came to fruition, and there was a team willing to give what we deemed the appropriate price, that we'd try to work with him,\" Lynch said.San Francisco traded picks in the second, third and fourth rounds in 2023 and fifth round in 2024 to Carolina for McCaffrey less that two weeks ago. McCaffrey had 10 touches for 62 yards two days after arriving in San Francisco in his debut with the team Oct. 23 and then made a much bigger impact on Sunday.McCaffrey had 18 carries for 94 yards, eight catches for 55 yards and threw a 34-yard TD pass. He became the fourth player since the merger to have a rushing, receiving and passing TD in the same game.Mitchell went down with a knee injury in Week 1 following a productive rookie season when he rushed for 963 yards and five TDs.NOTES: The Niners also released DL Akeem Spence, signed WR Willie Snead IV to the practice squad and released WR Malik Turner from the practice squad.

The Colts defeated the Broncos 12-9 in overtime. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey)ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos are trading star-crossed pass rusher Bradley Chubb to Miami for a package that includes the Dolphins' first-round draft pick next year.The Broncos (3-5) also get running back Chase Edmonds and a 2024 fourth-rounder from the Dolphins (5-3), who are getting a 2025 fifth-rounder from Denver.Chubb's departure comes a year after the Broncos traded franchise sacks leader Von Miller, who helped the Rams win the Super Bowl in February before signing with the Buffalo Bills this offseason.\"Decisions like this are not easy,\" GM George Paton said after a record-setting dozen players were dealt on NFL trade deadline day. \"... but ultimately we always have to do what's best for the team. And we don't make this decision if we're not confident in the players and the coaches on this team.\"Paton said the depth at edge rusher was strong enough for him to part with Chubb, and \"the draft value was significant. We just believed it was too good to pass up at the end of the day. And it's no secret we need picks. It's going to help us continue to build our football team.\"The Broncos went 3-6 after Miller's exit and Paton said he wanted fans and players alike to know this is no surrender.\"We believe in this football team,\" Paton said. \"We believe in our leadership. We believe in our depth.\"He also believes his lurching offense is going to come around.Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler also were coveted by other teams, but Paton chose to keep his receiving group intact as the team tries to develop more chemistry on offense.\"We wanted to keep our young, talented receivers,\" Paton said. \"We started to get some rhythm in our last game versus Jacksonville and we just feel good about where we're going. We're trending in the right direction with Jeudy and Hamler and Courtland (Sutton) and we didn't want to break that up.\"Paton worked out a secondary deal in acquiring fifth-year pass rusher Jacob Martin from the New York Jets in a trade that included an exchange of 2024 draft picks with the Broncos giving up a fourth-rounder and the Jets a fifth-rounder.The first-round pick Paton obtained in the Chubb trade is the one that the Dolphins acquired from San Francisco that allowed the 49ers to move up and draft quarterback Trey Lance in 2021. The Dolphins forfeited their own 2023 first-round selection and a third-round selection in the 2024 draft after an NFL investigation found that Miami violated the league's anti-tampering policy regarding communication with Tom Brady.Chubb was the fifth overall pick in the 2018 draft, a key part of Denver's stellar defense and a locker room leader, although some Broncos fans still smart over John Elway's bypassing of Wyoming QB Josh Allen, who went two picks later to Buffalo.Chubb has 5 1/2 sacks this season -- although none in the past three weeks -- and a pair of forced fumbles after coming off his first fully healthy offseason since his rookie year when he had a career-best 12 sacks playing alongside Miller.With the Broncos (3-5) off to a bad start under the Nathaniel Hackett-Russell Wilson coupling, Paton found more value in what he could get for Chubb in next April's draft than in the production he'd get from the former North Carolina State star over the next nine games.Even if the Broncos' record were flipped, Paton said, \"we would have made the trade regardless. We just felt the value was too good. ... Moving forward, we have other holes to fill on the offensive side of the ball.\"Paton had traded away his first- and second-round picks this year and next in the blockbuster deal that brought Wilson over from Seattle last spring.By avoiding the megadeal on the horizon had he kept Chubb, Paton now has the financial flexibility to re-sign rising defensive line star Dre'Mont Jones to a big extension. \"He is one of our core players,\" Paton said. \"We want him here a long time.\"Chubb said last week that the speculation he was a top trade target was \"kind of cool,\" in that \"it lets you know that I'm playing good ball where other teams notice it as well.\" But he added that he preferred to stay \"in Denver long term. I've got my house. I got everything. I'm comfortable.\"Chubb is making nearly 14 million on his fifth-year option this season. But his career features almost as many missed games (25) as sacks (26).He missed most of last season following surgeries on both ankles to remove bone spurs and didn't have a single sack in seven games upon his return. He also missed most of 2019 with a torn ACL, but bounced back in 2020 with a Pro Bowl season.Chubb's departure comes at a time the Broncos are hurting in the pass rush department with Randy Gregory (knee) and Baron Browning (wrist) on IR. Paton said Gregory probably won't be ready to return for Denver's next game, at Tennessee on Nov. 13.AP Sports Writer Alanis Thames and AP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. contributed to this report.More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Justin Rex)Running backs have been dominant in the Big 12 this season.Five of the top 13 Power Five conference rushers in yards per game hail from the league. Kendre Miller is a key reason unbeaten TCU has a shot at reaching the College Football Playoff. Texas' Bijan Robinson is projected by many to be a first-round draft pick. Deuce Vaughn -- a 5-foot-6 dynamo -- has fueled Kansas State's surprising run into the Big 12 title race. And Oklahoma's Eric Gray and Baylor's Richard Reese both average nearly 100 yards rushing per game.Miller averages 106.4 yards rushing per game and has scored 11 touchdowns for the 8-0 Horned Frogs. He ran for 120 yards and a touchdown in last week's 41-31 win over West Virginia.\"Kendre's stepped up like you hoped he would and I think has shown everybody, certainly, what he's capable of,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"I think (he is) one of the best running backs in college football -- just what he does and how he does it. And he's certainly incredibly valuable to us and the way that we use him. He's just a combination of power and balance and speed and can make big plays.\"Miller arrived at TCU with Zach Evans, a five-star recruit and the highest-ranked ever signed with Gary Patterson. Evans transferred to Ole Miss after TCU's coaching change, and Miller has stepped up by rushing for at least 100 yards in five of his past six games.\"When your number is called, you've just got to produce, and I think it's a big deal to do it week in and week out, so that's where I try to be with my game,\" Miller said. \"I try to stay consistent and do it every week, so that (separates) the great ones from the good ones.\"Miller has rushing touchdowns in all eight games this season and nine consecutive games overall going back to last season's finale. It's the second-longest streak in school history, trailing only NFL Hall of Fame running back LaDainian Tomlinson's 15 in a row from 1999-2000. Among active Power Five running backs, Miller's career 6.92 yards-per-carry is the most, just ahead of Evans' 6.86. Texas' Robinson leads the conference with 115.0 yards rushing per game. When his 280 yards receiving are added, his contribution jumps to 150 all-purpose yards per game - good for seventh nationally.Vaughn is second in the league with 112.8 yards rushing per game and has 130 yards receiving. \"He's got great hips and feet and vision,\" Oklahoma defensive coordinator Ted Roof said before his Sooners allowed 116 yards rushing to Vaughn. \"He's got a lot of patience too. He'll stay back there, wait for somebody to get nosy and jump out of their gap and then here he goes. At the same time, he's a weapon in the throwing game as well too. They get very creative in how they get him the ball.\"Gray has become Oklahoma's most consistent offensive player. He has rushed for at least 100 yards in five of his eight games. He averages 99.5 yards per contest. His 6.8 yards per carry rank seventh nationally.Reese -- a freshman -- is averaging 98.9 yards rushing per game for Baylor, and he leads the league with 12 rushing touchdowns. West Virginia's CJ Donaldson and Tony Mathis, Kansas' Devin Neal and Oklahoma State's Dominic Richardson also have had great moments and rank in the Top 10 in the league in rushing yards per contest.\"I think the league is really good,\" Dykes said. \"I mean, obviously everybody's kind of got backs that fit their personality. And they're all different. ... So you just look around the league, there's just a lot of really good running backs.\"AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas, contributed to this report.Follow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: twitter.com/CliffBruntAPMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

All Rights Reserved.JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of an Alaska legislative candidate to hold the seat.The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer \"Jennie\" Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week's election.The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as \"public interest litigants.\" Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations.But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. \"There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,\" Sullivan said by email.Sullivan said the \"next opportunity to challenge the candidate's residency qualifications would be in an election contest,\" should Armstrong win the general election.Armstrong's campaign, in a statement, said the timing of the lawsuit \"makes clear that it is intended to confuse voters and disrupt the Armstrong campaign. It won't work. This suit will eventually be resolved confirming that Jennie Armstrong was properly certified as an eligible candidate for House District 16.\"An attorney representing Armstrong, Scott Kendall, said he was seeking to intervene in the case on Armstrong's behalf.\"I think the outcome of this litigation is going to be extremely clear that she's qualified for office,\" Kendall said.The lawsuit points in part to a provision of the Alaska Constitution that states that a member of the Legislature \"shall be a qualified voter who has been a resident of Alaska for at least three years and of the district from which elected for at least one year, immediately preceding his filing for office.\" The candidate filing deadline was June 1. The complaint cites a social media post by Armstrong that it says was dated around June 13, 2019, and said \"last weekend, I moved to Alaska.\" It says in a resident fishing license application in late June 2020, she indicated she had been a resident for \"one year and zero months,\" and in a late July 2021 application indicated she had been a resident of Alaska for two years and one month. On a license effective in late July 2022, her residency is listed as three years, two months, according to a copy included in the legal filings.The lawsuit claims Armstrong \"did not demonstrate the intent to remain in Alaska until at least June 7, 2019\" and \"as late as August 26, 2019,\" when it says she registered to vote.Armstrong, in a statement, said Alaska \"has been my home since May 2019.\" Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)CINCINNATI (AP) -- Playing without Ja'Marr Chase, the Cincinnati Bengals had a rough night.One that could have ramifications for the rest of the season.Cincinnati lost its best cornerback when Chidobe Awuzie departed in the first half of Monday's ugly 32-13 loss at Cleveland because of a right knee injury. The 27-year-old Awuzie left the stadium on crutches, and coach Zac Taylor said the injury appears to be severe.If Awuzie is sidelined for an extended period, it's another tough blow for a Bengals team already playing without Chase because of a hip injury for the dangerous wide receiver.The growing list of health issues is one of several problems for Cincinnati (4-4), which dropped to 0-3 in the AFC North with its eighth loss in the past nine games in the \"Battle of Ohio.\"The Bengals were limited to two fourth-quarter touchdown passes by Joe Burrow in the loss to Cleveland. They managed just 36 yards on the ground, compared to 172 for the Browns, and Burrow was sacked five times.Evan McPherson missed a 47-yard field goal attempt and an extra point, and Cincinnati's defense allowed three second-half touchdowns after holding its opponent without a second-half TD in its first seven games.The Browns (3-5) had lost four straight games before hosting the Bengals in front of an amped-up crowd.\"This isn't the type of team we are,\" Taylor said. \"It's a 17-game season, and this is one game. We weren't at our best, in any phase. I'm confident that's not who we are, and we can make the corrections and flush this one away quickly.\"Burrow threw an interception on Cincinnati's first drive. He also lost a fumble in the second quarter.The Bengals finished with just 229 yards after rolling to 537 yards in a 35-17 victory over Atlanta on Oct. 23.\"We're a better offense than we put out there tonight, even without (Chase),\" Burrow said.Not much, actually. The yards are getting harder to come by for Mixon on the ground, but he did stay engaged as a receiver and picked up some tough yards after his catches. He had a team-high seven receptions for 32 yards as Burrow distributed passes to nine different receivers.The Bengals faltered behind an offensive line that was overhauled before the season but still lacks consistency and push. Tackle Jonah Williams allowed two first-half sacks that ended drives. With Chase out, Burrow struggled to make explosive plays.\"We weren't playing collectively,\" said receiver Tyler Boyd, who had three catches for 38 yards and a TD. \"We couldn't get that catch to get the offense going. We didn't protect Joe well. Everything was not going our way.\"Defensive end Sam Hubbard had nine tackles, including a sack, and two quarterback hurries. Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson are getting pressure, but the interior defensive line isn't the same without D.J. Reader and Josh Tupou, both out with injuries. Burrow, after throwing for a season-high 481 yards in the win over the Falcons, had a terrible game. It wasn't his worst statistically -- 232 yards, two TDs and a 71.4 completion rate -- but the game got out of hand quickly, and most of his production came after it was way too late.Awuzie's replacement, Tre Flowers, left the game with a hamstring injury. ... Hubbard may have injured his hand and was getting X-rays after the game.5 -- Cleveland's winning streak over the Bengals, its longest over a single opponent since re-joining the NFL in 1999.Cincinnati has a six-day week to address myriad issues before the Carolina Panthers (2-6) come to town Sunday ahead of an off week for the Bengals.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)NEW YORK (AP) -- Nashville midfielder Hany Mukhtar has been named Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Player after leading the league with 23 goals and 11 assists. The 27-year-old German's combined goals and assists were the fifth most for a season in league history. He was especially productive in the final 22 games of the season with 21 goals and seven assists. He had eight goals and four assists in August alone. Nashville finished fifth in the Eastern Conference standings and lost 1-0 to the LA Galaxy in the first round of the playoffs. Mukhtar, who joined Nashville in 2020, is the first German-born player to win the league's Landon Donovan MLS MVP award. No American has been voted MVP since Chicago Fire forward Mike Magee in 2013. The MVP is voted on by players, club technical staffs and the media. Mukhtar finished with 48.03 of the votes, followed by Austin's Sebastian Driussi with 16.8. Philadelphia goalkeeper Andre Blake finished third with 7.87. The Philadelphia Union and LAFC play Saturday in the MLS Cup final in Los Angeles.

All Rights Reserved.BOSTON (AP) -- The general manager of Boston's troubled public transit system, who shepherded the agency through the pandemic when ridership plummeted and has faced calls to resign during a federal safety review, announced Tuesday that he will step down early next year.Steve Poftak in a letter to employees of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said that his last day on the job will be Jan. 3, just days before a new governor is sworn in.\"Serving as MBTA General Manager has been the experience of a lifetime and it has been my honor and privilege to work with all of you,\" he wrote. \"While we have faced and will continue to face challenges, I believe in the strength and resilience of the MBTA. As I look back on my four years as General Manager, I take great pride in what we have accomplished together.\"The letter did not say what his plans were.Poftak, who was appointed to the MBTA's fiscal control board in 2015 by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, took over as general manager in December 2018 from Luis Ramirez, who spent just 15 months on the job. Baker's term ends in January and he is not seeking reelection.Ridership dropped when businesses moved to remote work during the pandemic. As of May 2020, bus ridership was at about 20 of pre-pandemic levels and weekday subway ridership dropped to 8 of pre-pandemic levels.The subway system, the nation's oldest, experienced a series of safety problems in the past year or so that prompted a review by the Federal Transit Administration.The FTA, in a highly critical report in June, issued four \"special directives,\" requiring 53 separate actions that the agency was required to take, including addressing worker shortages, prioritization of safety management, safety communication, and operating conditions, policies, procedures and training.Poftak in his Tuesday letter acknowledged problems, but also touted improvements the system has made under his leadership, including the investment of billions of dollars in modernizing the bus fleet and commuter rail infrastructure.\"And while we know we have more work to do on safety, we have made great strides as an organization, building staffing, expertise, and above all, commitment to making the system as safe as it can be,\" he wrote.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Luis Vieira)PORTO, Portugal (AP) -- After Porto lost its first two Champions League matches this season, few expected the Portuguese side to advance from a group in which Atletico Madrid was the heavy favorite.But when it all ended on Tuesday, it was Atletico lamenting a last-place finish and Porto celebrating the group win.Porto defeated Atletico 2-1 to finish first in Group B and keep the Spanish team from making it to the Europa League playoffs. Mehdi Taremi and Stephen Eustaquio scored first-half goals for Porto, which won its last four straight Champions League games to take over first place after Club Brugge was held to a 0-0 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in the other match. Porto finished with 12 points, one more than Brugge.Porto had started its campaign with a last-minute loss at Atletico and an embarrassing 4-0 home defeat to Brugge.\"We didn't get off to a good start but we knew that we only depended on ourselves,\" Porto forward Pepe said. \"In the end we reached our goal.\"Atletico had already been eliminated and needed a win to secure third place and a spot in the Europa League playoffs. Instead, Leverkusen earned that berth because of a better head-to-head tiebreaker against Atletico, which finished last in a Champions League group for the first time.It was also the first time since 2009 that Atletico has gone five matches without a win in the Champions League. At that time, it endured a nine-game winless streak that began in 2008.\"We didn't deserve to make it to the round of 16 and we didn't deserve to make it to the Europa League,\" Atletico forward Antoine Griezmann said. \"When you can only win one of your matches in the group stage, that's what you get. Now all we can do is shut our mouths, work hard and keep fighting.\" The loss will add pressure on coach Diego Simeone in what has been a lackluster season for Atletico. In the Spanish league, it sits in third place, eight points behind second-place Barcelona and nine points behind leader Real Madrid. \"The only way I know how to get out of situations like this is to stick together and get everyone involved -- the club, the fans and ourselves,\" Simeone said.Simeone's usually stout defense looked soft early on and Porto took advantage.Taremi opened the scoring from close range five minutes into the match for his 12th goal in all competitions this season, and Eustaquio added to the lead with a strike from near the penalty spot on a breakaway in the 24th.Taremi has scored 12 goals in 17 appearances in all competitions this season. He had scored two goals in each of Porto's last two Champions League matches.Griezmann thought he had pulled Atletico closer with a powerful shot into the top of the net in the 68th, but the goal was called off because of a foul by Atletico midfielder Rodrigo de Paul in the buildup.Atletico scored with an own-goal by Ivan Marcano in stoppage time. Porto has reached the last 16 or better in seven of its last 10 Champions League appearances, four of them during coach Sergio Conceicao's reign. It is only the second time in 10 seasons that Atletico failed to advance from the group stage, and first since 2017-18. It won the Europa League the last two times it didn't advance in the Champions League -- in 2018 and 2010.Simeone started with Joao Felix playing alongside Griezmann up front as regular starter Alvaro Morata recovered from an injury. It was Felix's first start in nine matches.Porto was still without veteran central defender Pepe because of a knee injury.Griezmann had scored a late winner to give Atletico a 2-1 win in the teams' first meeting. Since then, Atletico lost at Leverkusen and at Brugge before being held to draws at home by those same clubs. Simeone's team had a late chance to beat Leverkusen in the previous round but Yannick Carrasco missed a penalty kick awarded by video review deep into stoppage time.Porto was coming off a 4-0 win at Brugge and a 3-0 victory at Leverkusen. It had also beaten Leverkusen at home after the 4-0 loss against Club Brugge at its Dragao Stadium.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) -- Club Brugge missed out on winning its Champions League group after being held to a 0-0 draw on Tuesday at Bayer Leverkusen.Brugge had already secured a place in the last 16 as the first Belgian club to reach the knockout stage since Gent in 2015-16. Combined with Porto's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid in the other game in Group B, the draw with Leverkusen meant that Brugge missed out on becoming the first team from Belgium to win a Champions League group since Anderlecht 22 years ago. Leverkusen placed third and heads to the Europa League ahead of Atletico.The game started at a slow pace before gradually gathering intensity. Brugge's Kamal Sowah forced a good save from goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky in the 39th minute before Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong hit the side netting in first-half stoppage time.Both teams came close to taking the lead early in the second half, with Brugge's Canadian winger Tajon Buchanan blasting a shot against the crossbar in the opening seconds of the half. Former Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet stopped Brugge from falling behind when he pushed a dangerous Patrik Schick header over the bar at a corner.The draw leaves new Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso winless in six games following a victory over Schalke in his first game in charge on Oct. 8 as his team has slipped to third from last in the Bundesliga. It's the first top-division coaching job for the former midfielder, a two-time Champions League winner with Liverpool and Real Madrid.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley (18) runs the ball as Washington Football Team cornerback Kendall Fuller (29) defends during the first half of an NFL football game on Oct. 3, 2021, in Atlanta. Ridley is getting a fresh start in Jacksonville, although it's unclear when he will be allowed to play again. The Jaguars made a complex deal to land Ridley just before the NFL trading deadline Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. (AP Photo/Danny Karnik, File)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Suspended Atlanta receiver Calvin Ridley is getting a fresh start in Jacksonville, although it's unclear when he will be allowed to play again.The Jaguars made a complex deal to land Ridley -- and potentially give quarterback Trevor Lawrence a true No. 1 receiver in 2023 -- just before the NFL trading deadline Tuesday.\"This is an opportunity to add a proven playmaker to our already talented wide receiver room as we continue to build our roster for 2023 and beyond,\" Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. \"We are looking forward to finishing strong this season and integrating Calvin into our program at the appropriate time.\"A person with knowledge of the trade said compensation to the Falcons ranges between a second-round pick in 2024 and a sixth-rounder. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details had not been made public.The draft pick is contingent on when Ridley gets reinstated, how much he plays in 2023 and whether he signs a long-term deal with the Jaguars, the person said.Ridley tweeted \"Duuuval\" with two emojis of faces with steam coming from both nostrils, relaying the team's rallying cry.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Ridley in March for at least the 2022 season after a league investigation determined Ridley bet on NFL games in 2021 while away from the team addressing mental health concerns. The league said the suspension will carry \"through at least the conclusion of the 2022 season.\"The NFL said the betting took place during a five-day period in late November 2021. Ridley was placed on the non-football illness list following Week 8 last season, which ended Nov. 1.Ridley responded on his Twitter account that day, saying \"I bet 1500 total I don't have a gambling problem.\"A league investigation uncovered no evidence inside information was used or that any game was compromised by Ridley's betting. Nor was there evidence suggesting Falcons coaches, players or staff were aware of Ridley's betting activity.\"As our team continues its growth, we continue our daily focus on improving our roster and believe this move is the best decision to make at this time,\" Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot said. \"We appreciate Calvin's contributions to the organization and wish him well on his next steps.\"Ridley may petition for reinstatement after Feb. 23, 2023.The suspension wasn't the first time Ridley was unavailable to the Falcons. He sat out the final two months of the 2021 season and explained his absence in a Twitter post that read, \"I need to step away from football at this time and focus on my mental well being.\"Ridley was Atlanta's 2018 first-round draft pick from Alabama. He had 90 catches for 1,374 yards and nine touchdowns in 2020. He had only 31 receptions for 281 yards and two touchdowns before sitting out the final two months of the season.He is scheduled to count 11.1 million against Jacksonville's salary cap in 2023, which is the final year of his rookie deal.The Jaguars have Christian Kirk, Zay Jones and Jamal Agnew under contract next season, but the three are considered complementary receivers.

All Rights Reserved.NEW YORK (AP) -- A man has been arrested with the gun used in a shooting last month outside the Long Island home of Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, authorities said Tuesday.Noah Green, 18, was arrested Monday in Shirley on charges of criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of stolen property, Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney announced.Green's possible involvement in the Oct. 9 drive-by shooting outside Zeldin's house is still being investigated, the district attorney's office said. Two 17-year-old boys were wounded in the shooting.Zeldin, who faces Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in next Tuesday's election, was not at home when the shooting occurred but said his twin teenage daughters were in the kitchen doing homework and heard gunshots and screaming.According to court papers released by the district attorney's office, police officers conducting surveillance in connection with the shooting saw Green leave his residence in Shirley on Monday and get into a black Honda that had been reported stolen.When officers approached Green, he exited the Honda and tried to flee by jumping onto the hood of the police car, prosecutors said.Green reached for his pants pocket as officers tried to take him into custody, prosecutors said. Officers were able to grab Green's hand and recover a loaded 9mm pistol from Green's pocket, the district attorney's office said.A microscopic analysis of the pistol showed that it was the same weapon as the one used in the shooting outside Zeldin's house, the district attorney's office said.Additionally, prosecutors said, the car seen on surveillance video from the shooting scene was a black Honda \"consistent with\" the stolen car from Monday's arrest.\"The gun Green possessed was the weapon used in the shooting, but that does not mean that he was the shooter necessarily,\" Zeldin said Tuesday. \"This investigation is still ongoing, and we will continue to help law enforcement in any way we can.\"Green was arraigned and ordered held on 750,000 cash bail, 1.5 million bond or 7.5 million partially secured bond. He is due back in court Friday.Green's attorney at the Legal Aid Society did not respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.Tierney said in a statement that the investigation into the shooting is continuing and there will be more developments in the future.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)A Cleveland Browns fan cheers during the second half of an NFL football game between the Cleveland Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals in Cleveland, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. (AP Photo/David Richard)CLEVELAND (AP) -- In the waning minutes of October, the Cleveland Browns cut loose in their locker room, releasing the pent-up frustrations caused by weeks filled with mistakes and injuries that put their season in peril.There were smiles everywhere late Monday night, some yelling, a few sighs of relief.Crisp tackling, smart play-calling and sublime execution -- except for a botched trick play -- resulted in their best all-around game this season as the Browns extinguished a four-game losing streak with a 32-13 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, embarrassing the defending AFC champions in prime time.Written off. Knocked down. The Browns got back on their feet.\"We have a saying, 'Everything we want is on the other side of hard,'\" quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. \"You have to go through things for you to cherish things like this and a day like tonight.\"There's still plenty of room for improvement, but there are also encouraging signs for the Browns (3-5), who head into a bye week that will provide injured starters time to heal and the team to recharge for its next nine games.Brissett, who is down to a handful of starts with Deshaun Watson's expected return from an 11-game suspension later this month, savored a victory in which he outplayed Joe Burrow and posted the highest quarterback rating (133.7) of his career.Other than a fumble when he tried to throw as the pocket collapsed, Brissett had another strong performance as the Browns beat one of their AFC North rivals for the fifth straight time. He completed 17 of 22 passes (77) for 278 yards.Brissett, hardly known for his speed, also added a 3-yard touchdown run on a play that perhaps best exemplifies his season and the one the Browns are having.Flushed from the pocket, Brissett sprinted left and as he neared the goal line his mind flashed back to an eerily similar situation three weeks ago. On Oct. 9, Brissett forced a throw into the same end zone and was intercepted, a turnover that sealed Cleveland's fate in a 30-28 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.He wasn't making the same mistake. \"I have been beating myself up about that a lot just because that has been like sitting on my heart,\" said Brissett, who shook off several hard hits, including a blow to the throat. \"I always told myself if I ever get that opportunity again, I am going to make the right decision.\"This time, he dived and hit the pylon -- Browns 18, Bengals O.Brissett learned. So have coach Kevin Stefanski and the Browns, who after enduring some turbulent days early in the season's first two months believe better ones are ahead in November and December.\"The light was never gone,\" star end Myles Garrett said, disputing the idea the Browns flipped a switch. \"That's all we talked about: Empty the tank, 100 percent commitment to your craft and your brother.\"See what we can get out of it, especially going into the bye week. We had a lot of guys buy completely into that message, and it really showed.\"For the second straight week, Cleveland's much-maligned defense stepped up.With Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney pinching from the edges, the Browns were able to put constant pressure on Burrow, sacking him five times and rarely allowing Cincinnati's QB time to set his feet.Coordinator Joe Woods' seat has cooled considerably. Despite some key injuries, he's got his group playing at a high level, and the Browns will need to stay there in order to make any playoff push.Rookie Cade York had another long field-goal attempt blocked, this one from 53 yards. Either Cleveland needs to shore up its protection unit or York has to find a different trajectory on deep kicks. After all, his range is what prompted the Browns to draft him in the fourth round.Linebacker Sione Takitaki is making the most of more playing time following season-ending injuries to Anthony Walker Jr. and Jacob Phillips.The four-year veteran recorded a team-high 13 tackles -- including a couple in space to bring down running back Joe Mixon -- and added a strip-sack. Takitaki's performance also helped offset the absence of fellow linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, who was out with a knee injury.Hard to be too critical after a blowout win.But special teams coordinator Mike Priefer's units still aren't doing enough to make a major positive impact. While there were no major gaffes Monday night, Cleveland's punt and kickoff return teams haven't flipped the field often enough this season.The lone kickoff return against Cincinnati went for 11 yards.Stefanski said top cornerback Denzel Ward remains in concussion protocol after missing his third straight game. ... Tight end David Njoku (ankle), right guard Wyatt Teller (calf) and Owusu-Koramoah are all progressing and could be back after the bye.Zero -- The number of passes targeted to Cleveland's tight ends, a statistical anomaly and incredibly unusual for Stefanski, who uses more tight-end formations that any coach.A week to recover before a Nov. 13 visit to Miami, the first of four road games in five weeks for the Browns.AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.A copy of the proposed constitution of Alabama of 2022 is seen at the statehouse in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Alabama voters on Nov. 8 will vote whether to ratify a recompiled Alabama Constitution that strips racist language and deleted repealed and redundant sections. The state's governing document will remain the longest in the United States at over 300,000 words. (AP Photo/Kim Chandler)MONTGOMERY, Ala (AP) -- The Alabama Constitution, approved in 1901 to entrench white supremacy, still has language regarding segregated schools, poll taxes and bans on interracial marriage. But a seismic change could be in store. Alabama voters on Nov. 8 will decide whether to ratify a new constitution that strips out the Jim Crow-era language. It would also reorganize the unwieldy governing document, which has been amended 978 times and tops over 400,000 words. The Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama says the size makes it the longest such document in the world.Voters in 2020 authorized state officials and lawmakers to cut the racist language that lingers from the era of racial segregation. That work, finally completed, now goes back before voters to ratify the Alabama Constitution of 2022. Proponents say the changes that will demonstrate Alabama is a different place today -- and streamline the sprawling constitution to be more user-friendly. \"This is an effort to show, not only the rest of the country, but the world who we are today,\" said state Rep. Merika Coleman, one of the lawmakers who led the bipartisan effort. However, it does not make the policy changes that some reformers have sought -- such as giving counties more home rule and removing tax earmarks, which dedicate taxes to a specific program or purpose. To approve the measure, voters must vote 'Yes' on the question asking whether to ratify the \"Constitution of Alabama of 2022. \" The ratification question will appear on the ballot after the list of candidates for office. There is also a separate amendment, Amendment 10, to authorize the code commissioner to renumber and nest the newest amendments within the Constitution.The framers of the 1901 constitution were direct about their goal to maintain a government controlled by whites. \"The new constitution eliminates the ignorant negro vote, and places the control of our government where God Almighty intended it should be -- with the Anglo-Saxon race,\" John Knox, president of the constitutional convention, said in a speech urging voters to ratify the document.The Alabama Constitution has language allowing parents to opt for students to \"attend schools provided for their own race\" and sections about poll taxes, bans on interracial marriage and a convict labor system in which Black Alabamians, often arbitrarily arrested, were forced to work in mines and labor camps. The provisions were long ago invalidated by court rulings or later amendments, but the language remains in the state's government document.Alabama has seen efforts previously to invalidate racist language, but this goes further, said Othni Lathram, the director of the Legislative Services Agency. For example, voters in 2000 approved an amendment repealing an unenforceable interracial marriage ban -- although 40 of voters voted against the repeal -- but the language about the ban remains in the Constitution and \"you have to make it to the Amendment 667 to know that it's been repealed,\" he said. \"With the recompilation, it completely goes away,\" he said. The reorganization effort is designed to make the document more user-friendly, Lathram said. Repealed provisions will be removed and the nearly 1,000 amendments will be incorporated into the document. Amendments related to local areas will be organized by county so they can be more easily found. Tom Spencer, a senior research associate at Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama, said the proposal will strip remaining racist language. However, it will continue the current structure that centralizes power in the Legislature, and will not change the state's tax structure. The Alabama Constitution of 1901 is currently 420,000 words. The new Constitution would shrink slightly to 373,274 words, but that is three times more words than the next-longest state constitution - Texas, according to an analysis from the PARCA.\"Power will still be concentrated in the Legislature and local matters, like whether counties can regulate golf carts on public roads, will continue to clutter the state constitution ... And it will still be the world's longest constitution. Even with the organizational fixes, the document is a confusing mess,\" Spencer wrote. The state committee that worked on the recompilation and the lawmakers who approved it only had a narrow charge to delete racist or repeated language and to reorganize, according to Coleman. However, she is hopeful the ratification will be approved. Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

Late Monday, jurors sided with Behling's husband, son and daughter after a trial that lasted more than two weeks.Behling and her husband worked at manufacturing companies in the Springfield area, and the lawsuit alleged that work was connected to her illness.Lawyers for the family said Ford failed to provide warning that asbestos was present in dust created during repairs of vehicle brakes. Ford attorneys said Behling's exposure to the dust was limited and the family failed to prove it contributed to her illness.A statement from Ford offered sympathy to the family but said an appeal is planned.In another case heard in St. Louis in March, a jury awarded 20 million to a St. Louis County man who sued Ford.

(AP Photo/Jacob Kupferman)CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Refreshed from a week off, Clemson quarterback DJ Uiagalelei believes the site of his best showing in college will prove once more to doubters he's capable of leading the fifth-ranked Tigers to their championship goals. Uiagalelei watched the end of Clemson's last game from the bench, coming out in the third quarter after throwing a pair of interceptions and giving up a fumble that turned into a 90-yard scoop and score as then-No. 14 Syracuse opened a 21-10 lead. Backup Cade Klubnik sparked a 17-point rally in the second half as the Tigers (8-0) remained perfect with a 27-21 victory. Uiagalelei, Klubnik and Clemson coach Dabo Swinney all stressed the switch was for the moment, not forever. Uiagalelei gets to show there's no need for further change when the Tigers head to Notre Dame (5-3) on Saturday night. \"I felt like I figured out what I did wrong, stuff to work on,\" he said. \"Be able to improve that and make sure it doesn't happen again. I feel like I've definitely moved on from that and excited about playing Notre Dame.\" Some of Uiagalelei's excitement this week surely comes from memories of his last visit in 2020. Uiagalelei was a freshman picked to start as national championship passer Trevor Lawrence missed his second game with COVID-19. Uiagalelei threw for three touchdowns and 439 yards, the most ever by an opposing passer at Notre Dame Stadium. The only drawback for Uiagalelei that day? The Tigers lost 47-40 in double overtime. \"Yeah, I played great,\" he said. \"But the biggest thing for me was the loss.\" Uiagalelei hopes to right that defeat this time around. No one's lost confidence in him because of his showing against Syracuse, said Clemson receiver -- and Uiagalelei's high-school teammate -- Beaux Collins. \"He may be down about it Sunday, but when we come in Monday, he's in good spirits and has moved on,\" Collins said. \"I'm never worried about him.\" Neither, said Swinney, should Clemson supporters, some of whom have taken a wait-and-see approach to Uiagalelei's tenure since his uneven first year as a starter in 2021 when Clemson finished 10-3, yet ended its run of six straight Atlantic Coast Conference titles and College Football Playoff trips. Uiagalelei has grown much since last season and Swinney thinks that will show itself down the stretch. He compared it to Major League Baseball teams watching their ace get tagged for more hits and runs than they usually give up. \"He's had some bad moments and snapped out of it,\" Swinney said. \"He's a totally different guy. Our expectation is for him to play his best game.\" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman was most impressed with Uiagalelei's demeanor after Klubnik came in. \"To watch that quarterback being the first one cheering the group on, to be the first one to clap for (Klubnik), that tells you they have a team,\" Freeman said. \"It's not a bunch of selfish individuals, it's a team.\" Don't look for Uiagalelei to approach his passing yards from the last visit to Notre Dame. He's only once in the 21 games since eclipsed 300 yards -- when he threw for 371 yards and five touchdowns in a 51-45 overtime win at Wake Forest in September. Where Uiagalelei had excelled this year, until Syracuse, is protecting the football. He had 10 interceptions with just nine touchdowns in 2021 and this year had vastly improved his accuracy with 17 touchdowns and only two picks in Clemson's first seven games. Uiagalelei worked on ball security and keeping his passes from floating on him and into the hands of opposing defenders. He also took time last week to catch up on school, spend more time with his girlfriend and head to his home in California to visit with family. The time away was therapeutic, he said, and put him in the right frame of mind to continue Clemson's chase for another league title and a spot in the College Football Playoff. \"It was good for me,\" Uiagalelei said.

Jackson has also been bothered by a back injury, which sidelined him for the past three games -- all Commanders victories attributable in part to improved play on defense.Trading Jackson rather than cutting him allows Washington to save on the salary cap next season.The Steelers are looking for help in a secondary that has struggled to stay healthy and effective.

All Rights Reserved.EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- U.S. Border Patrol agents launched pepper balls at a group of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border along the Rio Grande in El Paso after the agency said one person threw a rock at one agent and another was assaulted with a flagpole.Video captured Monday by the El Paso Times shows Border Patrol agents approaching the group, which included a man holding a very large Venezuelan flag, that had crossed the shallow river.Border Patrol spokesperson Landon Hutchens said in a statement that as the group of Venezuelan nationals protested along the river, they tried to enter the U.S. illegally.\"One of the protesters assaulted an agent with a flag pole,\" Hutchens said. \"A second subject threw a rock causing injury to an agent at which time agents responded by initiating crowd control measures.\"Those measures included launching \"less-lethal force\" pepper balls, he said. The projectiles release an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat.Hutchens said the crowd then dispersed and returned to Mexico. Hutchens did not give details on the agents' injuries.Before the conflict at the river Monday, a group of migrants had marched in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, demanding an opportunity to cross the border, the newspaper reported.According to a new Biden administration policy that took effect last month, which came in response to a dramatic increase in migration from Venezuela, Venezuelans who walk or swim across the U.S. border will be immediately returned to Mexico.The Biden administration has agreed to accept up to 24,000 Venezuelan migrants at U.S. airports while Mexico has agreed to take back Venezuelans who come to the U.S. illegally over land.Roberto Velasco, Mexico's director for North American affairs, tweeted Monday that the Mexican government had requested information from its U.S. counterparts about the confrontation. Jonathan Blazer, director of border strategies at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the footage \"highly alarming.\" \"People seeking asylum on U.S. soil should be screened for protection, not pushed back, especially through use of force,\" Blazer said.According to statistics from Customs and Border Protection, its officials used \"less-lethal\" force -- such as batons, stun guns, tear gas and pepper spray -- 338 times in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.Hutchens said the Customs and Border Protection's Office of Professional responsibility will review Monday's incident.

(AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court's decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information.The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver's license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state.Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be \"chilling in today's world\" and the law would violate the First Amendment.United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year.Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\"Our state Legislature continues to try to destroy the initiative process with these kinds of laws,\" said Rick Weiland, the director of Dakotans for Health. \"We've had success in the federal courts based on the First Amendment.\"Weiland said that the ruling from three appeals court judges who were appointed under former President Donald Trump showed the importance of \"protecting a long-standing tradition to circulate and pass laws at the ballot box.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

France Sr., a public safety consultant, former correctional administrator and 27-year member of the Baltimore Police Department, to serve as the receiver to temporarily manage the jail and improve conditions. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)JACKSON, Miss (AP) -- A federal judge has appointed a receiver to temporarily manage a jail near Mississippi's capital city to improve conditions.U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves on Monday selected Wendell M. France Sr., a public safety consultant, former correctional administrator and 27-year member of the Baltimore Police Department to remedy \"ongoing unconstitutional conditions\" at the Hinds County Raymond Detention Center. On July 29, Reeves placed the jail into receivership after citing poor conditions for prisoners. Reeves said that deficiencies in supervision and staffing lead to \"a stunning array of assaults, as well as deaths.\" Seven people died last year while detained at the jail, he said in his July ruling.Reeves also wrote that cell doors did not lock and that a lack of lighting in cells made life \"miserable for the detainees who live there and prevents guards from adequately surveilling detainees.\" He also said guards sometimes slept instead of monitoring the cameras in the control room.Hinds County board President Credell Calhoun told the Mississippi Free Press that local officials will weigh their legal options for how to respond. Federal and state judges have ordered receiverships or a similar transfer of control for prisons and jails only about eight times, according to Hernandez Stroud, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.France began transitioning into his role Tuesday, but he will not have full operational control over the jail until Jan. 1. According to the terms of the receivership laid out by Reeves in court documents, France will have 120 days from the date of his appointment to develop a draft plan reforming the jail's conditions. France was chosen from a field of four candidates. After conducting interviews, Reeves chose France based on his \"diverse experience in corrections and criminal justice system leadership,\" court records show. He will be compensated 16,000 per month.In addition to his experience as a police officer, France served as deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, where he managed a 22 million budget and 400 employees, Reeves said. He has also worked as a consultant for the U.S. Department of Justice.An online job profile for France also shows that he is the president of a consulting firm that provides \"expert witness service to federal, state, municipal government agencies and private attorneys.\"Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Airbnb's website is displayed on a web browser on May 8, 2021, in Washington. Airbnb reported a record 1.21 billion profit for the third quarter as bookings and average daily rates increased, and the company said Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, that demand for short-term rentals remains strong despite uncertainty over the economy. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)Airbnb reported a record 1.21 billion profit for the third quarter as bookings and average daily rates increased, and the company said Tuesday that demand for short-term rentals remains strong despite uncertainty over the economy.The profit and bookings were both less than Wall Street expected, however. The company said bookings growth will slow in the fourth quarter while average daily rates will also be pressured. Airbnb shares fell 7 after about two hours of extended trading.Airbnb shares have dropped nearly 35 this year despite the recovery in travel, a highly profitable first half of the year, and relentlessly upbeat commentary from CEO Brian Chesky and other company leaders.Most of the share-price decline has occurred since early May. Investors worry that higher prices for basics including housing, food and gas -- plus fear of recession -- will cause consumers to cut back on discretionary spending like travel.Airbnb faces other, more fundamental threats, perhaps none bigger than the perception among many guests that bookings on the site are no longer a bargain because of high cleaning fees and misleading listings. Chesky tweeted last month that changing how Airbnb displays its prices is \"one of my top priorities.\" He said Tuesday that pricing was built around displaying the nightly rate first -- fees levied by the host and the company are added as customers go through the booking process, and can boost the final bill significantly.\"One of the things we have been hearing from guests -- and we heard it loud and clear -- is that people would like a little more transparency about what they're actually paying,\" Chesky said on a call with analysts. He promised more details soon.Another sore spot for renters: Some have posted photos of detailed lists of chores that hosts demand they perform. The discontent runs both ways -- hosts are increasingly complaining about problem tenants. Airbnb is fighting a long-running battle to crack down on unauthorized parties, a few of which have ended with shootings. The company also faces more efforts by local residents and governments to regulate the short-term rental market. Many large cities in the U.S. and overseas have added expensive permit requirements to operate a short-term rental, and they fine property owners who don't follow the rules. The trend is spreading to smaller cities. Officials in the Dallas suburb of Plano are considering tougher rules after a prostitution bust at an Airbnb in a residential neighborhood.The third-quarter profit, which compared with 834 million in the same quarter last year, amounted to 1.22 per share. Analysts expected 1.47 per share, according to a survey by FactSet.Revenue surged 29 from a year earlier, to 2.88 billion, slightly higher than analysts' forecast of 2.85 billion.The number of nights and experiences booked rose 25 over last year's third quarter, and the value of bookings jumped 31. Airbnb forecast that fourth-quarter revenue would be between 1.80 billion and 1.88 billion. The midpoint of that range would fall short of Wall Street's 1.87 billion forecast.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Chris Machian/Omaha World-Herald via AP)A family walks by police tape after Omaha police shot a man who drove through a barricaded area during a neighborhood Halloween celebration in Omaha, Neb., late Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. (Chris Machian/Omaha World-Herald via AP)OMAHA, Nebraska (AP) -- A police officer shot and wounded a man who drove around barricades and into a crowded Halloween block party in Omaha after ignoring the officer's orders to stop and continuing toward the officer, authorities said Tuesday.The shooting happened at around 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out.Kaitlin Harper was with her young son near an entrance to the block party when the car entered the cordoned-off area, she said.\"I only saw him drive past me and into the crowd, then I was on the phone with 911 and he was gone,\" she said. Moments later, after the car had traveled about six blocks, Harper heard the gunshots. She grabbed her son, ran to their car and \"got out of there.\"Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely.Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. Grainy doorbell video posted online shows the car easing through the crowd, then accelerating. It's not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.An officer, later identified as Bryson Blandford, was already at the scene handing out candy when the car came around the barriers, police said. Blandford ran into the street in front of Levering's car, held up a hand and yelled for Levering to stop, but Levering drove toward the officer and the crowd behind him, leading Blandford to shoot him, police said. Levering was taken to a hospital in critical condition but is expected to survive. Police did not immediately answer questions about a motive or whether investigators had been able to speak to Levering since the shooting.A search of court records shows that Levering has a long history of mostly misdemeanor crimes in Omaha dating back to his teens, including about a dozen traffic-related charges for driving while his license was suspended, driving with no proof of insurance and failing to appear for some of those charges. Last month, a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear in court on a misdemeanor charge of having no proof of insurance to drive.Police said Blandford -- a four-year veteran of the force -- has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard whenever officers shoot someone. Police said the confrontation and shooting were captured on the officer's body camera, and the Nebraska State Patrol and Sarpy County Sheriff's Office are helping to investigate.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting California officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay.The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90 were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general's office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI's database, and nearly 800 resulted in \"hits\" or matches with offenders in the database.Another nearly 200 kits were not submitted for testing for reasons including that the suspect already was known or the victim was not seeking to prosecute. The annual report for last year is not yet completed.The evidence is collected during medical examinations following sexual assaults, and can be used to link the assault to a suspect in existing DNA databases or develop a DNA profile that can be used in the future. The new online system provides information to survivors on the status of their sexual assault evidence collected since January 1, 2018. Victims can track whether their kits have been received by a law enforcement agency, are being sent to a laboratory for testing, have been received by a lab, are undergoing DNA analysis or have had the DNA analysis completed.California is among 30 states and Washington, D.C., that have committed to establishing a tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation founded by producer, director, actress, and advocate Mariska Hargitay. However, \"that doesn't address the older kits that are some places still sitting on shelves,\" said Ilse Knecht, the group's director of policy and advocacy.A 2020 audit looking mainly at kits collected before 2018 found nearly 14,000 untested kits at the local level across the state prior to the new law.Crain's job \"is the first of its kind that will focus on the rape kit backlog,\" Knecht said. \"The goal is to get those kits that are older than 2018...to get a real count of what the number is across the state and then make sure they're being sent in for testing.\"Her job will include linking law enforcement agencies with public or private laboratories, according to Bonta's office. Crain most recently was deputy chief for Oakland's Department of Violence Prevention. Previously she was executive director of Bay Area Women Against Rape, the nation's oldest rape crisis center.Aside from Crain's assistance, Knecht said she will propose that California legislators next year pass a law requiring local agencies to test those old kits.The tests generated some controversy earlier this year when San Francisco's prosecutor revealed that police there had used a DNA sample collected from a woman during a 2016 rape investigation to link her to a burglary in late 2021. State lawmakers passed a law banning the practice.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Arkansas coach Eric Musselman speaks during a news conference for the NCAA men's college basketball tournament in San Francisco, Friday, March 25, 2022. Musselman has been one of the nation's best at dipping into the transfer portal, at Arkansas and his previous stop in Nevada. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)Eric Musselman has been one of the nation's best at dipping into the transfer portal at Arkansas and at his previous stop in Nevada.Musselman is still adept at landing elite high school recruits -- his 2022 class was second nationally -- but adding quality transfers was a big part of the Razorbacks' consecutive Elite Eight runs. \"Veteran players through the transfer portal can have a immediate impact both as starters and as role players,\" he said. \"Much like NBA free agency, with college transfers there is a body of work and less projection on how a player's impact can be. Transfers have been through the rigors of college basketball and can add some experience both from a game playing standpoint and a culture standpoint.\" Musselman isn't alone in his thinking; most of the top-tier programs have used the transfer portal to their advantage.The thought process has created a ripple effect in the recruiting world.The transfer portal was created in 2018 to ease transfers from one school to another. Now that players don't have to sit out a year after transferring, a college version of free agency has spawned, enhanced even more by name, image and likeness compensation opportunities.With more programs opting to add experienced players from the portal, the opportunities for the non-five-star recruits to play at high-major programs have dwindled. Players further down the recruiting rankings -- usually past the top 75 -- are not getting the same high-major interest as before.Before the transfer portal, players that were maybe fringe high-major prospects could wait until the spring recruiting period and see their stock rise. Top programs desperate to fill out their rosters would often take a chance on a recruit, but now there's no need when they can add a transfer who's already proven himself.In 2017, the year before the portal opened, three players ranked between No. 75 and 125 in the 247Sports composite committed to mid-major programs. Flash forward to 2022 and seven players in the same range ended up at mid-majors.As those players drop down to mid-major programs, the players behind them drop farther down the line in the college hoops hierarchy. \"You see a lot of kids go underrecruited,\" said Travis Branham, national basketball analyst for 247Sports. \"A kid used to wait until the spring and, oh, the high-majors are going to come calling -- that's not the case anymore.\"The ease of the portal has also pushed coaches toward transfers. With high school recruits, there's often multiple layers of involvement, from coaches to family and friends. Coaches also have to devote months or years of keeping in contact and traveling to watch recruits who ultimately end up choosing to go somewhere else.The portal expedites the process. The players are more mature, usually know what they want and a decision typically comes quickly.\"Coaches actually seem to enjoy recruiting in the portal more than they enjoy recruiting high school kids,\" Branham said. \"You're dealing with a lot less (hassles), the recruitments are quick and you can figure out things quickly.\"The recruiting ripples from near the top of rankings spread down through college basketball.Mid-majors that were losing players to high-majors needing to fill out rosters now are getting higher-quality -- or at least higher-ranked -- players not available to them in the past. The shift continues down to the smaller Division I schools, who suddenly find themselves in the conversation for recruits who never would have even looked their direction in the past.\"We're trying to get a couple of high school kids that before the transfer portal, we wouldn't even be talking to because they would be signed by those mid-majors receiving (poll) votes,\" Northern Arizona coach Shane Burcar said. \"The top 75 and down, Dukes, North Carolinas and Michigan States are holding off on those guys. Absolutely it's impacting high school kids.\"More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A Florida-based health records company has agreed to pay 45 million to resolve allegations that it improperly generated sales and caused users to report inaccurate information, the U.S. attorney's office in Vermont announced Tuesday.The government alleges in the civil case that Modernizing Medicine Inc., of Boca Raton, violated the False Claims Act and the anti-kickback statute through three marketing programs that increased its business and that of a laboratory company it was working with. \"Electronic health records serve a critical role in informing physician decision making, and it is therefore essential that healthcare providers select such technology free from the influence of improper financial inducements,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Department of Justice's Civil Division, said in a news release. A lawyer for Modernizing Medicine did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Modernizing Medicine solicited and received payments from the other company in exchange for recommending and arranging that its customers utilize the other company's laboratory services, prosecutors said.Modernizing Medicine conspired with the other company to improperly donate its health electronic health records technology to health care providers to increase business for itself and the other company, prosecutors said.Modernizing Medicine made payments to its current health care customers and to other influential sources in the industry to recommend its electronic records, prosecutors said.The government alleged that Modernizing Medicine caused health care providers to submit false claims for reimbursement to the federal government for pathology services and for incentive payments from the Department of Health and Human Services \"for the adoption and 'meaningful use'\" of Modernizing Medicine's electronic health records technology.The settlement resolves allegations filed in Vermont by a former Modernizing Medicine vice president under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act. The former official will receive about 9 million.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

During the \"rolling road rage situation\" that began in the Hillsborough area around 7 p.m. Monday, Kelly Long, 41, of Hurdle Mills, fired several times at an occupied vehicle, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a news release. After the chase, the other driver pulled over at a gas station on Highway 70 and deputies responded, officials said. The driver initially reported no injuries, but deputies found a projectile lodged in the back of a safety seat and a corresponding minor injury to the back of the driver's 4-year-old child, officials said. The boy was treated on the scene and didn't need further medical care, officials said.A deputy found shell casings in the roadway and made contact with an area resident whose security system captured video footage of the vehicles as they passed by, officials said. Early Tuesday, investigators arrested Long and charged him with four counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. Court records show that a specific public defender hasn't been assigned to Long's case, according to the clerk's office. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Randall Park and Melissa Fumero co-star in the new Netflix comedy \"Blockbuster,\" following the employees at the one remaining Blockbuster video rental in the world. It debuts Nov. 3. (Nov. 1)Actors are accustomed to change, always beginning and ending new projects in various locations with new people. But for Melissa Fumero, who starred in \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" for eight seasons, taking on a new role in the Netflix series \" Blockbuster \" was anxiety-inducing.\"I told myself 'Look, that kind of magic doesn't happen again. You had your one unicorn in your career. It's probably never going to be that good again,\" Fumero said in a recent interview. Those jitters went away when co-star Randall Park and the rest of the cast assembled to film the 10-episode show about the employees of the sole surviving Blockbuster video store.\"I met this cast and met Randall, and we started all working together, and it was literally the same magic unicorn again. I can't believe it.\" Park -- best known for the ABC comedy \"Fresh off The Boat\" which aired for six seasons -- plays Timmy, the proud manager of a Blockbuster store in a small town in Michigan. Quickly into the first episode he gets word that all remaining Blockbusters will be shut down effective immediately, corporate's office is being turned into a WeWork, but Timmy's Blockbuster can remain open because it still generates a small amount of business. He becomes the de facto owner of the last Blockbuster in the world. (The actual last remaining Blockbuster is in Bend, Ore.)Timmy loves his job, his coworkers, and connecting with the people who come to his store. In the pilot episode, as Timmy chats with a customer who hasn't rented a movie in a while, he says, \"What's it been? Three years this March?\" The customer breaks it to him that he's been using Netflix, but ends up renting \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" on Timmy's recommendation to help get through a breakup.Timmy's genuine belief is that the in-person exchange of renting a movie, or just leaving the house to visit any brick-and-mortar store, is valuable because human beings need socialization. His employees (played by actors including Madeleine Arthur, Olga Merediz and Tyler Alvarez) don't exactly match his conviction, but they'll go along with his lofty ideas to bring attention to the store -- and to keep working.\"Timmy is the same kind of boss I would be, I think. Which is not necessarily a good thing,\" said Park. \"The problem with Timmy and the problem with me, is this deep desire to be liked. ... He puts out a lot of positivity and a lot of love. That's what really speaks to me about the character. But his need to be liked gets him in trouble often.\"Vanessa Ramos, \"Blockbuster\" creator and showrunner, says when she was coming up with its characters Park is who she had in mind all along for Timmy.\"In my original pitch, Timmy was described as 'a Randall Park- type,' and that was because they're like, 'there's no way we can get Randall Park.'\" Enter Netflix, which suggested sending it to Park and seeing what happened.\"He read it and was in. In my brain I was like, 'OK, this is as good as it going to get. Like, I've really lucked out here,'\" said Ramos.That good fortune continued when her pal and former colleague Fumero, whom she wrote for on \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" became available. Fumero plays Eliza, a down on her luck Blockbuster employee who previously worked with Timmy at the store when they were in high school and he's had a secret crush on her ever since. Eliza went to Harvard -- for a semester -- but dropped out because she got pregnant. She married, had a baby and is now separated from her husband whom she caught on a date with another woman in the Costco cafe.\"The thing about Eliza that I was really drawn to was this woman who things didn't go exactly the way she thought they would,\" said Fumero. \"We're catching her at this moment in her life where she's figuring out what's next and who she is after she's already raised a kid.\"Timmy and Eliza have a classic will they/won't they running storyline which the actors say they enjoy.\"Everyone loves a romance,\" said Park. \"The fact that these two characters also had a history before, makes it so special and different and complicated and all those things. I'm very invested.\"Fumero says \"Blockbuster,\" like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" is a workplace comedy where employees become family and in some ways know each other better than family.\"No matter what industry you work in are these little dysfunctional families that exist everywhere and these people that you spend all these hours with every day and it's a part of everyone's life.\"Follow Alicia Rancilio at http://www.twitter.com/aliciarCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake arrives to a rally with former President Donald Trump on Oct. 9, 2022, in Mesa, Ariz. The Republicans running for Arizona's three top statewide offices have said they would not have signed off on the presidential results if they had held office in 2020 and have signaled that they want to overhaul the battleground state's elections.(AP Photo/Matt York, File)PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona county's plan to hand count all ballots cast in next week's election has triggered a court challenge, marking the latest twist to the effort by rural Cochise County to mollify skeptics distrustful of its vote-counting equipment.The lawsuit came Monday as Democrats agreed to help provide volunteers to assist in the tally of an estimated 50,000 early and Election Day ballots in the Republican-heavy county, which strongly backed former President Donald Trump in 2020. State law on hand counts, which are usually limited to a small percentage of the votes, says party chairs from at least two recognized parties must provide a list of people to help count the vote and no more than 75 can be from the same party. The counts would be in addition to the official machine tabulation.Arizona has become the hotspot for election denialism these past two years, and in recent weeks armed people have staked out ballot drop boxes in an effort to dissuade what they contend is potential illegal voting. A federal judge last week refused to issue an order blocking the poll-watching, saying the groups organizing it had a First Amendment right to be there. That prompted the Justice Department to jump into the fray Monday, saying the efforts raise concerns about illegal voter intimidation. The two Republicans on the three-member Cochise County board of supervisors have pushed for the full hand count, and the GOP county Recorder is going along, saying he believes that five races on the ballot can be hand counted in just two days. That seems optimistic, given issues in rural Nye County, Nevada, where a nascent hand-count effort was beset with issues before the state Supreme Court halted it last week. County officials there are tallying more than two dozen races and are pledging to restart the count as soon as possible. Cochise County's full hand count was blessed by the Republican attorney general, whose office issued an informal opinion last Friday saying the county could tally all early and Election Day ballots. The secretary of state's office has said that is illegal, however, and warned that it may sue. It OK-ed hand-tallies of all Election Day ballots but said counting all the early votes, which make up more than 80 of ballots in most counties, would be illegal. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is a Democrat who is running for governor. An independent group called the Arizona Alliance of Retired Americans did not wait, suing Cochise County and several of its officials on Monday. The presiding judge sent the case to nearby Pima County to avoid a conflict since county officials were named. A judge in Tucson has not yet set a hearing schedule. The lawsuit seeks an order halting a full hand count of early ballots, echoing the legal view of Hobbs' office. The county board's decision has led to fiery meetings in the past week, with the lone Democrat vowing to do all she could to block the effort and the county attorney siding with the secretary of state and saying a full count would be illegal. At a brief meeting on Tuesday where the board was to talk about hiring outside lawyers for the two Republicans, nothing was accomplished after no one would make a motion to consider the item. Efforts to hand-count ballots are driven by unfounded concerns among some Republicans that problems with vote-counting machines or voter fraud led to former President Donald Trump's 2020 defeat.Supervisors in Pinal County, a much larger and growing suburban area just south of metro Phoenix's Maricopa County, also have been considering a hand count. That board plans to discuss the issue on Wednesday, The elected Republican county attorneys in both jurisdictions have warned their respective boards that there is no legal authority to expand a hand-count of ballots.

LOUIS (AP) -- A St. Louis jury has ruled that Ford Motor Co. and other companies must pay 6 million to a Missouri family over claims that a woman's death was caused by asbestos exposure, including from dust generated during brake repairs. Linda Behling of Springfield died of mesothelioma at age 70 in 2019. Her family's lawsuit cited years of work by Behling and her husband at manufacturing companies in the Springfield area. Jurors sided with the Behling family Monday night. Lawyers for the family alleged that Ford failed to warn the public that asbestos was present in dust created during brake repairs.

The U.N. said Tuesday that three ships carrying corn, wheat and sunflower meal left through a humanitarian sea corridor set up in July. A total of 14 ships also sailed Monday following Russia's weekend exit from the grain deal. But future shipments are in doubt after the U.N. said vessels wouldn't move Wednesday. Turkey is trying to broker a resolution. Analysts say Russia is likely using it's withdrawal as a bargaining chip to get what wants from the deal, such as easing the way for its fertilizer exports.Political spat over climate risks in investments gets hotterST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The political fight is only getting fiercer over whether it's financially wise or \"woke\" folly to consider a company's impact on climate change, workers' rights and other issues when making investments. Republicans from North Dakota to Texas are ramping up their criticism of what's called \"ESG investing,\" a fast-growing movement that says it can pay dividends to consider environmental, social and corporate-governance issues when deciding where to invest pension and other public funds. At the same time, Democrats in traditionally blue states like Minnesota are considering whether to make ESG principles an even bigger part of their investment strategies.Strong RSV vaccine data lifts hopes after years of futilityA new study suggests vaccinating pregnant women protects their newborns from the common but scary respiratory virus called RSV. The virus is a nuisance for most healthy people but it can be severe for babies and older adults. Efforts to create a vaccine have failed for decades but some recent promising studies are raising hopes that one might finally be getting close. Pfizer reported preliminary results of its pregnancy vaccine Tuesday, a shot it also tested successfully in older adults. Rival GSK also has reported success with its vaccine version in seniors.Job openings hit 10.7M despite Fed attempts to cool economyWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting that the American labor market is not cooling as fast as the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve hoped. Employers posted 10.7 million job vacancies in September, up from 10.2 million in August, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Economists had expected the number of job openings to drop below 10 million. For the past two years, as the economy rebounded from 2020's COVID-19 recession, employers have complained they can't find enough workersKey issue as Fed meets this week: When to slow rate hikes?WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve may reach a turning point this week as it announces what's expected to be another substantial three-quarter-point hike in its key interest rate -- its fourth straight. Fed officials will likely engage in a fraught debate over whether it may soon be time to slow its rate hikes, which are intended to cool the worst inflation in four decades but are also raising the risk of a recession. At a news conference Wednesday after the Fed's latest meeting, Chair Jerome Powell could signal a forthcoming shift to smaller rate increases. Doing so would give officials time to assess the impact of the hikes.Musk floats paid Twitter verification, fires boardBillionaire Elon Musk is already floating major changes for Twitter as he begins his first week as owner of the social-media platform. One proposal would make some users pay if they want to keep a blue check mark on their profile. Twitter has historically used the mark to verify higher-profile accounts, including Musk's, so that other users know it's really them. Critics have derided the mark as an elite status symbol. Musk has invited a group of tech-world friends and investors to help guide the San Francisco-based company's transformation, which is likely to include a shakeup of its staff.Uber sees few signs of customer pullback despite inflationShares of Uber are surging after the company said there is little evidence that Americans are pulling back on hailing rides or ordering food deliveries despite soaring inflation. The company said Tuesday that it expects fourth-quarter gross bookings to rise 23 to 27 from last year. Shares of Uber, down almost 30 this year, jumped 15. In the most recent quarter, gross bookings increased 26 to 29.1 billion. The San Francisco ride-hailing service struggled during the pandemic amid lockdowns, but has thrived with the rollout of vaccinations as Americans head back to the office, go out on the town, or stay home and order dinner from a restaurant.Airbnb posts 1.2 billion profit in 3Q as revenue jumps 29Airbnb is reporting a 1.2 billion profit for the third quarter but giving a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter. The short-term rental company said Tuesday that demand for short-term rentals remains strong despite economic uncertainty. Airbnb shares have been under pressure this year, dropping more than 30 since January despite the recovery in travel. Airbnb's challenges include consumers cutting back on discretionary spending like travel due to higher prices for food and gas. Its users are also complaining more about Airbnb's high fees. The CEO says redesigning Airbnb's pricing structure is a top priority.The SP 500 fell 15.88 points, or 0.4, to 3,856.10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.75 points, or 0.2, to 32,653.20.

(AP Photo/Nick Cammett)Injured Cleveland Cavaliers guard Darius Garland cheers on the team from the bench during the first half of a NBA basketball game against the Washington Wizards, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane)CLEVELAND (AP) -- All-Star point guard Darius Garland went through his first full-contact practice since suffering a serious left eye injury and could return Wednesday night when the Cleveland Cavaliers host the Boston Celtics.Garland has been sidelined for five games since he was accidentally poked in the eye by Toronto's Gary Trent Jr. in the Oct. 19 season opener. Garland sustained a cut to his eyelid, and has been dealing with excessive swelling.The 22-year-old took part in the Cavs' workout on Tuesday and stayed on the floor afterward for extra drills with Cleveland's assistant coaches. The Cavs have gone 5-0 without Garland, who has been on Cleveland's bench wearing dark sunglasses during his on-court absence.Garland is listed as questionable for the Celtics game, and coach J.B. Bickerstaff said his availability remains in doubt.\"We'll see tomorrow,\" he said. \"He went through everything. It's how he's feeling tomorrow and what the swelling looks like. But he was good today.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)A look at what's happening in the Champions League on Wednesday:AC Milan hosts Salzburg with a spot in the last 16 up for grabs alongside Chelsea, which is already assured of winning the group ahead of its home match against Dinamo Zagreb. Milan leads Salzburg by a point and would advance by avoiding defeat against the Austrian champions. The Italian team is guaranteed to still be in European competition in the new year because it cannot finish fourth even with a loss. Salzburg, however, could drop to last place by losing at the San Siro and if Dinamo also win at Chelsea, which is likely to rotate heavily amid a hectic run of games for Graham Potter's team.Either Leipzig or Shakhtar Donetsk will qualify in a last group game, which is effectively a playoff. A win and a spot in the last 16 for Shakhtar would continue a remarkable story for a Ukrainian team which has had to play its European home games -- including this one -- in Poland because of the Russian invasion. Leipzig would qualify instead with a win or a draw, continuing its recovery under coach Marco Rose, who was hired in September after Leipzig lost at home to Shakhtar. Real Madrid has already advanced, but after its loss at Leipzig in the previous round, the defending champion needs a win against Celtic at home to secure first place in the group. Carlo Ancelotti's team has suddenly struggled, and it followed its loss to Leipzig in Germany with a home draw against Girona in the Spanish league. There's nothing left to play for, with Manchester City guaranteed to top the group, Borussia Dortmund sure of advancing in second place and Sevilla certain to finish in third place and drop into the Europa League qualifying playoffs. City manager Pep Guardiola has said he will rotate his lineup against Sevilla, with striker Erling Haaland again missing because of various complaints including a foot injury. FC Copenhagen has two points from five matches but has yet to score a goal ahead of the visit of Dortmund. Paris Saint-Germain and Benfica have already qualified for the last 16 and Juventus and Maccabi Haifa are out. Still to be decided is who ends up qualifying as group winner and who gets third place and a spot in the Europa League. PSG will be assured of top spot with a win over Juventus away, while Juventus can secure third place if Haifa loses at home to Benfica. Lionel Messi has scored four goals in his last three Champions League games for PSG and had two goals and two assists in the 7-2 win over Haifa last time out.More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

At its best, it's a quietly affective portrait of unlikely friends hoping they can help each other make it to the shore.That analogy fits with a film where water plays a crucial role. Lawrence's Lynsey comes back from Afghanistan to clean pools -- an odd sort of high school profession for a veteran soldier -- until we learn she was a member of the Army Corps of Engineers tasked with building a dam when her convey was hit by roadside blasts. Remarkably, she wants to go back to war and as soon as she can: \"I need to get out of here!\"As she rehabilitates, Lynsey finds peace in the swirls of water and the placidness of an empty swimming pool. At first she just cleans them while the owners are away and then she starts to swim in them, too. Water seems to be her escape -- panic attacks send her to the shower -- and her place to cleanse. It is no coincidence that this motif has been chosen for a story set in a city ravaged by floodwaters.The screenplay by Luke Goebel, Ottessa Moshfegh and Elizabeth Sanders is unrushed and grounded in real language and a real city. The audience will recognize the hurt hiding behind many lines, as when Lynsey's mother asks her, \"Why did you want to go so far away?\" She knows the answer deep down -- it is her.Her accidental friendship with the mechanic (Brian Tyree Henry, brilliant as always) forms the spine of this story and yet they are opposites. She is white; he is Black; she is itching to get out, he is settled; he is straight; she is not. His injury is visible, the loss of part of his left leg; hers is invisible. But they share a survivor's guilt and a perfect knowledge of where the other's blind spots are. A scene when she convinces him to swim at night and they happily splash about like giddy teenagers is a highlight.Along for the ride are some of Broadway's finest talents, like Jayne Houdyshell as Lynsey's caretaker tasked with reteaching her basic motor skills, Stephen McKinley Henderson as her stern doctor and Linda Emond as her mother. Emond, in particularly, turns in a sublime performance, both self-centered and distant but also needy and piteous. \"Don't judge me!\" she asks her daughter at one point. They have a heartbreaking scene when they share, yes, a kiddie pool.But almost everything rests on Lawrence here. It is her movie and to play our war-injured veteran she scrubs away her glamor in favor of sneakers, jeans and oversized T-shirts, her hair in a ponytail. Since her injury is to her brain means there are no prosthetics or makeup to use as props and Lawrence does an admirable job, moving mechanically but intently in a haze of a prescriptions chemicals. She is often captured in silence, processing, as light crosses her face.When she accidentally drops a mound of fluffy shaved ice, she lashes out at herself. She does the same in a remarkable moment when her face goes from elation to sudden sadness when she is behind the wheel for the first time since the bombing: \"Driving a car shouldn't be a victory.\"In \"Causeway,\" loss is never far, with a sense that the missing are ever-present. It looks at where we seek safety -- far away, at home, even behind bars -- and how we process guilt and weakness. This isn't a film with fireworks or a plot neatly tied up. By the end, Lynsey is not swimming alone, and for this film, that counts as progress.\"Causeway,\" an Apple TV release which hits the streamer on Friday, is rated R for some language, sexual references and drug use.

All Rights Reserved.HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pennsylvania officials cannot count votes from mail-in or absentee ballots that lack accurate, handwritten dates on their return envelopes, the state Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday, a week before tabulation will begin in races for governor, the U.S. Senate and the state Legislature.The court directed county boards of elections to \"segregate and preserve\" those ballots. The justices split 3-3 on whether making the envelope dates mandatory under state law would violate provisions of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states that immaterial errors or omissions should not be used to prevent voting. Written opinions laying out the court's reasoning were not immediately available. State and national Republican Party organizations and several GOP voters sought immediate review by the Supreme Court, bypassing lower courts, once it became clear some county officials planned to throw out ballots without the proper dates and others were expected to count them. The individual voters were dismissed from the case by the high court's order.Ronna McDaniel, head of the Republican National Committee, called it a \"massive\" win for election integrity. \"Republicans went to court. Now Democrats have to follow the law,\" she tweeted.The Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the state party sued Secretary of State Leigh Chapman and election boards in every county. Beth Rementer, press secretary for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, said the decision was under review but showed it was important \"that voters should carefully follow all instructions on the ballot and double check before sending.\"Pennsylvania counties have reported receiving more than 850,000 completed mail-in ballots from the roughly 1.4 million that voters have requested. About 70 of requests have come from Democrats and about 20 from Republicans.The total number of the undated envelope ballots is likely small but may be enough to determine the winner of a close race. In the 2020 presidential election, Philadelphia reported receiving almost 381,000 mail ballots. Among them were about 8,300 undated ballots.Officials in various counties have said they were already putting ballots without dates on the return envelopes into separate piles in anticipation of a court ruling. Some counties may try to notify voters that their ballots are missing the dates, providing those voters the ability to visit their election offices to fix them.On the issue of the federal civil rights law, Democratic Justices Debra Todd, Christine Donohue and David Wecht saw a violation of federal law, while Democrat Kevin Dougherty and Republicans Kevin Brobson and Sallie Mundy did not. The status of ballots without properly dated envelopes has been repeatedly litigated since the use of mail-in voting was greatly expanded in Pennsylvania under a state law passed in 2019.Last week, Department of State officials under Wolf argued in a brief that state law between 1945 and 1968 directed county election boards to set aside mail-in ballots when the envelope date was later than the date of the election. But a 1968 change in state law, they said, deleted from a section of the Election Code \"the requirement that counties set aside ballots based on the date appearing on the ballot-return envelope.\" The dates are not used to verify whether ballots are received in time to count on Election Day; that happens when counties time-stamp them upon arrival. There has been evidence that at least some Pennsylvania counties have deemed any date to be acceptable, even dates in the future.Republican litigants had urged the justices to rule based on the language of state law, that voters \"'shall ... fill out, date and sign the declaration' printed on the outer envelope of the ballot.\" As an alterative, they asked the justices to have ballots from undated or improperly dated return envelopes segregated. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that the dates aren't mandatory, but recently the U.S. Supreme Court deemed that decision moot, leading to the current litigation.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- A pair of falls on the balance beam in qualifying cost Jordan Chiles a shot at the world all-around gymnastics title.She's going home with a gold medal anyway.Chiles essentially assured the U.S. women of a sixth straight world team championship on Tuesday, drilling her beam routine during the three-up/three-count finals as the Americans pulled away from host Britain.Chiles' nervy 13.333 on the beam led the U.S. women during the finals and essentially turned the Americans' fourth rotation on floor exercise into a victory lap. It also served as a measure of redemption for the 21-year-old Chiles, who won team silver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but came to Liverpool hoping to finish one step higher on the podium.The U.S. team of Chiles, Shilese Jones, Jade Carey, Leanne Wong, Skye Blakely topped the scoring in three of four events (vault, uneven bars and floor exercise) on its way to posting an all-around total of 166.564, more than three points clear of host Britain in second at 163.363.\"I stayed confident and trusted my gut,\" Chiles said. \"And everybody trusted me.\"Chellsie Memmel perhaps most of all. The 2005 world champion and 2008 Olympic silver medalist is now the high-performance technical director for the U.S. women's program. She did not hesitate writing Chiles' name into the lineup in the finals, positive that Chiles would bounce back.\"She needed to do that for herself,\" Memmel said. \"She needed to do that to prove to herself that she could do that when she needed to. I think she's going to feel 100 times better going home.\"Canada rounded out the top three for the first time at the world championships, with 27-year-old Ellie Black's rock-solid beam routine in the final rotation helping the Canadians surge to a team total of 160.563, nearly a full point better than Brazil. Not bad for a team that barely squeaked into the final spot in the eight-team final.Black, the most accomplished Canadian gymnast in the program's history, wept when her country's flag moved into third.\"I couldn't believe it and I didn't want them to joke with me that we maybe could be third,\" Black said. \"I'm just blown away. I'm so proud of the team. Going into the final we were eighth and we said we could only go up from there.\"Way up. All the way to Paris in fact.Canada, along with the U.S. and Britain, automatically qualified for the 2024 Olympics a couple of hundred miles away in the City of Lights.Russia, the reigning Olympic champion, is currently banned from competing at FIG and European Gymnastics federation-hosted events due to the war in Ukraine.A year after finishing second to the Russians at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the U.S. returned to the top spot by relying on the experience of Chiles and Carey -- both of whom won medals in Japan -- and the resilience of Jones.Save for a fall by Blakely on beam, the U.S. avoided major mistakes, taking the lead on vault in its first rotation and never letting Britain get within real striking distance.\"Obviously my hope was that we would bring home the team gold and get into all of the finals and they've done that,\" Memmel said. \"Three up, three count is high pressure and a lot is at stake and they handled it.\"The U.S. team could get even stronger over the next 21 months.Reigning Olympic champion Sunisa Lee has indicated she plans to return to elite training at some point after her sophomore season at Auburn. Simone Biles, the 2016 Olympic champion and the most decorated American gymnast of all time, has not ruled out making a bid for a third Games, and 2012 Olympic champion Gabby Douglas is working out in Texas, though her plans are unknown. Konnor McClain, who won her first U.S. title in August, is recovering from a back injury.The current group of U.S. stars, however, still has work left to do at MS Bank Arena. The Americans have at least one athlete in each of the five remaining finals, starting with Carey and Jones in the all-around final on Wednesday.\"We're capable of doing big things and more,\" Jones said.

All Rights Reserved.PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia police have announced the arrest of a fourth suspect in September's ambush shooting outside a Philadelphia high school that killed a 14-year-old and wounded four other teenagers after a football scrimmage.Police said Monday the 16-year-old is the fifth person authorities have identified as believed to have been involved in the Sept. 27 shooting outside of Roxborough High School. One 16-year-old suspect identified in the case remains at large.Authorities said five people jumped from a parked SUV and opened fire on teens who were walking away from an athletic field at the high school. Nicholas Elizalde, 14, of suburban Havertown, was killed and three other teens were wounded and rushed to a hospital. One was treated at the scene.Police have said they don't believe Elizalde was one of the intended targets of the attack. They said one of the shooters chased a 17-year-old victim down the street, striking him with shots to the leg and arm, and tried to fire as he stood over the victim but the gun either jammed or was out of bullets.Police have said they were seeking a total of six suspects: five shooters and a driver. At the time they said four suspects had been identified, they said those suspects would face charges of murder, four counts of aggravated assault, firearms crimes and other counts. The shooting drew national attention around the U.S. amid a string of mass shootings and also came just after Philadelphia surpassed 400 homicides for the year, only slightly behind the pace of last year's toll, which ended up being the highest in at least six decades.Hours before the shooting, Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, signed an order banning guns and deadly weapons from the city's indoor and outdoor recreational spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. A judge barred the city from enforcing that order, siding with a legal challenge citing a state law that prevents any city or county from passing gun-control measures.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - A Cuban flag, shredded by the winds of Hurricane Ian, flies in the air while children play in the seawater from the waves breaking on Malecon in Havana, Cuba, Thursday, Sept. 29, 2022. Eighteen former Latin American and Caribbean leaders have signed a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden to be released Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022, asking the United States to remove its six-decade embargo on Cuba in the wake of devastating damage inflicted by Hurricane Ian. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File)HAVANA (AP) -- Eighteen former Latin American and Caribbean leaders have signed a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden asking the United States to remove its six-decade embargo on Cuba in the wake of devastation inflicted by Hurricane Ian.The letter, shared with The Associated Press ahead of its Wednesday release, also requests that Biden remove Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism for providing refuge to leaders of a guerrilla group that is now set to reenter peace talks with Colombia, an American ally.The letter comes as Cuba is suffering its worst economic, political and energy crises of the century so far, spurring a migratory exodus from the island. It was exacerbated by Hurricane Ian, which walloped western Cuba before hitting southern Florida late last month.\"We ask you, Mr. President, to take into account this dramatic situation that thousands of Cubans are experiencing and do whatever is necessary to lift those restrictions that affect the most vulnerable,\" the letter reads.Among the signatories are former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, two former Colombian leaders -- Juan Manuel Santos and Ernesto Samper -- and former leaders from Bolivia to Belize.All of the signers are leftists or centrists. Notably absent were signatures from right-wing politicians, underscoring the deep divisions that the Caribbean island still provokes in the region.The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to vote this week on a resolution to condemn the trade embargo and it is expected to pass again for the 30th consecutive year.Yet former Colombian President Ernesto Samper told The Associated Press in an interview that he doesn't want the letter to be viewed as a political statement.\"At this moment, what worries us is that the ones paying the cost ... are Cubans who are going without food, medicine or electricity,\" Samper told the AP.The trade embargo was imposed in 1962 as the Cuban revolution veered toward socialism. It has restricted Cuba's access to a vast array of products, as well as international aid, and financial resources.Island officials say the restrictions have made it harder to recover from the hurricane, which destroyed 14,000 homes and caused long-term damage to the country's electrical grid.While the Obama administration eased many sanctions, they came back into full force under the Trump administration, which justified the sanctions by re-designating Cuba as a state sponsor for terrorism for its refusal to extradite 10 leaders of Colombia's biggest remaining guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army.But that order was lifted when Colombia's first leftist leader was inaugurated in August and announced new peace talks with the group. The rebel leaders recently left Cuba to hold negotiations in Venezuela.Biden has eased a few measures, but has also been sharply critical of the Cuban government's harsh treatment of protesters last year -- which also hardened sentiment against concessions to the Cuban government among Cuban-Americans, a key voting bloc in Florida.But the administration recently made a few friendly gestures, offering 2 million in emergency relief to help with hurricane recovery.Fully lifting the embargo also would require authorization by Congress at a time deep of political division in the U.S., only made more difficult by approaching midterm elections in which Florida is a swing state.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - The U.S Supreme Court is seen, Oct. 11, 2022 in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer for a man on Arizona's death row told the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday that jurors in the case were wrongly told that the only way to ensure the man would never walk free was to sentence him to death. The man, John Montenegro Cruz, argued that the jury should have been informed he would be ineligible for parole if spared from death. Cruz says Arizona has been defying the Supreme Court on the issue.Cruz's lawyer, Neal Katyal, says efforts to tell the jury that Cruz was not parole-eligible were rejected. Arizona says Cruz failed to make the precise requests he needed to under Supreme Court precedent.At least one juror has said that had she known that a \"life sentence without parole\" was an alternative to death, she \"would have voted for that option.\"The case is important not only for Cruz, but also for other inmates on death row in Arizona who are in the same situation. Cruz was convicted of the 2003 murder of Tucson police officer Patrick Hardesty. Hardesty and another officer were investigating a hit-and-run accident that led them to Cruz, who attempted to flee and shot Hardesty five times. A 1994 Supreme Court case, Simmons v. South Carolina, says that in certain death penalty cases, jurors must be told that choosing a life sentence means life without the possibility of parole. That's required when prosecutors argue that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future.In a 2016 case, Lynch v. Arizona, the Supreme Court told Arizona directly that it needed to comply with Simmons. But Cruz says Arizona has continued to defy the high court.\"It sounds like you're thumbing your nose at us,\" Justice Elena Kagan told lawyer Joseph Kanefield, who argued for Arizona.The case is not necessarily one that will divide the court between its six conservative and three liberal justices.In addition to Kagan, the court's two other liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested Cruz should get a new penalty phase of his trial where it's clear to jurors that he's ineligible for parole if he's not sentenced to death. But conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett also at one point suggested sympathy for Cruz's view, saying Arizona's argument \"just seems like hair splitting.\" Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch suggested they would vote for the state.The case is John Montenegro Cruz v. State of Arizona, 21-846.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski)Indianapolis Colts running back Nyheim Hines (21) celebrates a touchdown against the Washington Commanders in the second half of an NFL football game in Indianapolis, Fla., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/AJ Mast)ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The AFC-leading Bills refused to stand pat Tuesday at the NFL trade deadline with general manager Brandon Beane filling key needs in Buffalo's offensive backfield and injury depleted secondary.Beane began by adding an established pass-catching dimension in acquiring running back Nyheim Hines in a trade with the Indianapolis Colts. Buffalo traded third-string running back Zack Moss and a conditional sixth-round pick in next year's draft to the Colts to land Hines, who provides the Josh Allen-led offense an experienced dual threat.Beane then filled an important depth need on defense by trading a seventh-round pick to acquire safety Dean Marlowe from Atlanta. Marlowe has seven seasons of NFL experience, and is familiar with the Bills defensive scheme after a three-year stint in Buffalo from 2018-20.Despite having little room under the salary cap, the sixth-year GM elected to augment a roster that has Buffalo off to a 6-1 start, matching its best record through seven games since 1993.Buffalo has won four straight in coming off a 27-17 win over Green Bay on Sunday, and preparing to travel to play the New York Jets (5-3) this weekend.Hines fills a role behind starter Devin Singletary that Beane has been eager to address since free agency in March, when J.D. McKissic reneged on an agreement to sign with Buffalo by returning to play for Washington.In his fifth NFL season, Hines joins an offense which leads the league in yards gained, yards passing and ranks second in points scored. He is expected to assume the third-down role currently held by rookie James Cook, who has been used sparingly this season.Fresh off scoring his first touchdown of the season on a 5-yard run in a 17-16 loss to Washington last weekend, Hines has 18 carries for 36 yards, and 25 catches for 188 yards in seven games. Overall, the 25-year-old has 1,205 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns, and 1,725 yards receiving and seven touchdowns in 72 career games since being selected by the Colts in the fourth round of the 2018 draft.He has two more seasons left on a three-year, 18.6 million contract extension he signed in September 2021.Moss, a third-round pick in 2020, became the odd-man out in Buffalo after seeing his role start to decrease last season. He was inactive in each of Buffalo's last two games, and has 17 carries for 91 yards, plus seven catches for 27 yards.Moss scored four TDs rushing and one receiving in each of his first two seasons in Buffalo.Marlowe rejoins a Bills defense thin at safety. Starter Micah Hyde had season-ending neck surgery after being hurt in Week 2, while fellow starter Jordan Poyer's status is uncertain after he hurt his elbow against Green Bay.The Bills are welcoming back Tre'Davious White after activating the starting cornerback from the physically unable to perform list on Tuesday, though it's too early to determine whether he'll play this weekend. White has been out since tearing a ligament in his left knee in a 31-6 win over New Orleans 11 months ago.The Bills freed up space on their roster by releasing defensive tackle Brandin Bryant and receiver Isaiah Hodgins.Buffalo also shuffled its practice squad by reinstating cornerback Xavier Rhodes and releasing cornerback Jordan Miller. The 32-year-old Rhodes injured his hamstring shortly after being signed by the Bills in late September.AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Joseph Cress/Iowa City Press-Citizen via AP)Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren speaks during Big Ten NCAA college basketball Media Days Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn)MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Big Ten's 2023 football schedule caused a big gulp for Gophers fans when it was finally unveiled last week.The three crossover games against East Division foes assigned to Minnesota next fall? Michigan and Michigan State at home. Ohio State on the road. That'll be quite the test for the Gophers, who will be replacing sixth-year starters at both quarterback (Tanner Morgan) and tailback (Mohamed Ibrahim). This could also be the last time a Big Ten team ever receives such a daunting surprise, if the conference decides to follow the trend and ditch the two-division format once UCLA and USC arrive in 2024.In that case, the Big Ten would likely designate up to three rivals for each program out of protection for the annual grudge matches -- Michigan-Ohio State, Minnesota-Wisconsin, Indiana-Purdue and so on -- that make up the rich history of the league. Then teams would play the remaining opponents on an every-other-season basis to strike better competitive balance and maintain more scheduling consistency to thus avoid the post-expansion quirks like Purdue not visiting Michigan since, yes, 2011 or not playing at all since 2017. The Boilermakers, for the record, will play the Wolverines at the Big House next year.\"I think it's less about the rivalries and more making sure that our players and our fans are able to step into every venue and able to experience the pageantry of Big Ten football and find a way to be able to put that into the schedule,\" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said this summer at media day. \"It's going to be complicated. \"But when you look at it from a holistic standpoint, I hope that's the experience of our Big Ten student-athletes. Being able to play a game in Piscataway, New Jersey, and going out and able to play a regular season game in the Coliseum or the Rose Bowl and everything in between, nobody else will be able to say that.\"One of the many mantras and slogans employed by the Gophers under coach P.J. Fleck is the \"one-game championship season\" approach to each week, a preparatory view designed to eliminate distraction and focus on the present. Fleck, predictably, responded with a smile but little else when the topic of future schedules -- including his own team's challenge next year -- was raised at his news conference this week.\"There's a lot of unanswered questions right now and not much certainty about what the Big Ten will look like in terms of how many teams, divisions, pods,\" Fleck said. \"Nobody really knows. All we have to focus on is right now. I'm glad we're in the Big Ten. I'm glad we're at Minnesota.\"The soon-to-expand College Football Playoff will factor into what the league decides for a future format, with the addition of more schools always possible. The Pac-12 ditched divisions prior to this season. The Big 12 recently announced it will stick with a single group when four new schools join next year. The ACC is doing away with its divisions in 2023 as well. The SEC still has East and West divisions for 2023, but Oklahoma and Texas are on the way with no guarantee of future geographical organization.The Big Ten created divisions -- the ill-fated Leaders and Legends groupings that prioritized competitive balance over geographical proximity -- in 2011 when Nebraska became the 12th member. The entrance of Maryland and Rutgers in 2014 triggered another realignment, resulting in the current East and West divisions.Even after the ninth conference game was added to the schedules in 2016, there are four other schools that each team does not face in a given season -- nowhere close to a round-robin format. The pandemic-shrunken 2020 schedule also threw a wrench into the system. The finalization of the Big Ten's new TV contracts were delayed by the UCLA-USC addition, too, which in turn pushed out the 2023 slate and the ultimate decision for Commissioner Kevin Warren on the fate of the divisions.Not all the wrinkles were ironed out. Penn State, strangely, will play its first conference game on the road for the eighth straight year and the 13th time in 14 seasons, and athletic director Patrick Kraft issued a statement about the school's \"incredibly frustrating and disappointing\" feelings.\"When I arrived on campus, I shared with the conference staff my concerns and repeatedly referenced their failure to address this issue in the past. I have been in communication with Commissioner Warren and I am confident that this issue will be addressed moving forward,\" said Kraft, who was hired earlier this year.AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - This combination of photos shows Jeremy Goodale, left, and Willard Miller at the Jefferson County Courthouse in Fairfield, Iowa, on Nov. 23, 2021. The two Iowa teenagers were motivated to kill their high school Spanish teacher because of frustration over a bad grade in the teacher's class, prosecutors said Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, for the first time in court documents posted in online court records. (Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Des Moines Register via AP, File)DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two Iowa teenagers killed their high school Spanish teacher last year because of frustration over a bad grade, prosecutors said Tuesday in court documents that for the first time reveal a possible motive.The documents were filed ahead of a hearing Wednesday where a judge will hear arguments on whether to suppress any of the evidence against Willard Miller and Jeremy Goodale, who are charged with murdering high school Spanish teacher Nohema Graber in the small town of Fairfield. A lawyer for Miller is asking the court in Fairfield to invalidate four search warrants and suppress evidence from Miller's home, comments he made to police and information taken from his cellphone and the social media platform Snapchat.Graber's body was found in a Fairfield park Nov. 3, 2021, hidden under a tarp, wheelbarrow and railroad ties. She had been beaten to death with a baseball bat. Miller and Goodale were 16 at the time.Fairfield is a town of about 9,400 people that's some 100 miles (159 kilometers) from Des Moines.Investigators found that Miller met with Graber at Fairfield High School on the afternoon of Nov. 2, 2021, to discuss his poor grade in her class. Graber later drove her van to a park where she was known to take daily walks after school, authorities say. Witnesses saw her van leaving the park less than an hour later with two males in the front seat. The van was left at the end of a rural road. After getting a phone call from Goodale, a witness later picked up Goodale and Miller as they walked to town on that road, investigators say.In a police interview, Miller described the frustrations he had with the way Graber taught Spanish and over how the grade in her class was lowering his GPA.\"The poor grade is believed to be the motive behind the murder of Graber which directly connects Miller,\" court documents filed by Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding and Assistant Iowa Attorney General Scott Brown said.Miller initially denied any involvement in Graber's disappearance but \"later stated he had knowledge of everything but did not participate,\" according to court documents. He told police that the real killers -- a \"roving group of masked kids\" -- forced him to provide his wheelbarrow to help move her body and to drive her van from the park. The documents say a witness provided photos of a Snapchat conversation \"that identify Goodale's admissions that he acted in concert with another person to bring about Graber's death.\" The witness identified Goodale as making statements that implicate both Goodale and Miller by name.Miller's lawyer, Christine Branstad, says that the search warrants were issued illegally in part because \"law enforcement failed to provide information to the issuing magistrate to show the informant is reliable or that the information from the informant should be considered reliable.\"Miller is scheduled for trial on March 20 in Council Bluffs, and Goodale's trial is Dec. 5 in Davenport.Both teens, now 17, will be tried as adults. In Iowa, the penalty for a first-degree murder conviction is life in prison. Iowa Supreme Court rulings require juveniles convicted of even the most serious crimes to be given a chance for parole.

All Rights Reserved.Republican Gov. Tate Reeves responds to a reporter's question during a news conference Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, in Jackson, Miss., regarding his calling lawmakers into special session Wednesday to consider incentives for an economic development project. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he will ask legislators to approve about 240 million in state incentives for an economic development project in the northern part of the state.The Republican governor declined to name the company, saying he had signed a nondisclosure agreement.\"Once we get through the legislative process and once we get final agreements signed, we will announce that the deal is done,\" he said during a news conference.Reeves said the company is large and \"has a long history of success.\"Mississippi governors often have quick timelines to push incentives packages through the Legislature for large economic development projects, and it's not unusual for them to try to keep company names secret until deals are complete.Some legislators have raised concerns about the special session that begins Wednesday.\"We don't have many details at the moment, but we're concerned that GOP leaders will try to push some kind of corporate welfare package through with little debate or oversight,\" Republican Rep. Dana Criswell of Olive Branch, a member of the Mississippi Freedom Caucus, said in an email Tuesday.Reeves announced Monday that he is calling legislators to the Capitol to consider incentives for a company that would create 1,000 jobs within the next few years. He said the average salary would be 93,000 -- significantly higher than than the average pay for jobs in one of the poorest states in the U.S.The project includes \"a flat-rolled aluminum production facility, biocarbon production facilities and certain other industrial facilities,\" Reeves said in a news release. The facilities would be in the Golden Triangle area, which encompasses Columbus, Starkville and West Point and is near the Alabama border.The proposed state incentive package includes 155 million in direct contributions, about 25 million for roads in and around the project site, money to help purchase land and income tax rebates, Reeves said Tuesday.He said many legislators \"probably have a pretty good idea who the company is\" and the project could attract other businesses.\"This is going to be transformative for that region of our state,\" Reeves said.The governor said the company would spend 2.5 billion, which would be the largest up-front investment to date for a company seeking state incentives to locate in Mississippi.The previous record was in 2016, when Continental Tire announced a 1.45 billion investment to build a manufacturing plant in central Mississippi. The German company promised 2,500 jobs with an average pay of about 40,000 a year. During a 2016 special session, legislators approved 263 million in borrowing for Continental, including 20 million to be repaid by Hinds County. With other tax breaks and aid, The Associated Press estimated the value of all incentives to Continental would exceed 600 million. The Continental plant opened in 2019.Reeves said conversations about the new project began less than four months ago.He said the state will have \"aggressive\" provisions to recover its investment if the company does not fulfill promises. Republicans control the Mississippi House and Senate. Reeves said he hopes members from both parties will support the project.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Two brothers have been convicted of murder in the grisly cold case stabbing deaths of a Detroit-area woman and her 11-year-old daughter, prosecutors said.A jury deliberated less than two hours Monday before convicting Tony Johnson, 42, and Henry Johnson, 37, of two counts each of premediated first-degree murder and premeditated felony murder, the Macomb County Prosecutor's Office said.The brothers face mandatory life sentences without parole, prosecutors said. Tina Geiger, 36, and Krissy Geiger, 11, were slain July 24, 2013, in their Clinton Township apartment. Tina Geiger suffered about 60 stab wounds and Krissy had more than 20 stab wounds, mostly to her neck, the Detroit Free Press reported. The case was closed but reopened in 2019 by the Clinton Township Police Department. A bloody palm print and DNA found on the girl matched Tony Johnson, prosecutors said. DNA also confirmed blood found in the stairwell and on a railing outside the apartment came from a male relative of Tony Johnson's. Henry Johnson resided in the same apartment complex. Tony Johnson was identified on video surveillance at a convenience store at the same time as the victims, prosecutors said. Investigators believed the brothers walked the victims home, sexually assaulted the girl and stabbed both victims.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.PHOENIX (AP) -- Lawyers for an Arizona death row inmate scheduled to be executed on Nov. 16 have filed a new appeal.Murray Hooper's attorneys filed another petition for post-conviction relief Monday in Maricopa County Superior Court, saying \"newly discovered material facts\" have been discovered in the case and the 76-year-old inmate should be entitled to a new trial.Hooper's defense team also filed a petition in September requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing.They said Hooper was convicted and sentenced on unreliable witness testimony, no physical evidence links him to the crime and an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial.Hooper and two co-defendants were sentenced to death in 1982 for the murders of William \"Pat\" Redmond and his mother-in-law, Helen Phelps, during a home robbery in Phoenix on New Year's Eve 1980.Redmond's wife, Marilyn, was shot in the head but recovered.Lawyers for Hooper said Marilyn Redmond's description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who has maintained his innocence in the double slayings. \"Because there is no physical or forensic evidence placing Mr. Hooper at the scene, or in Arizona, the unreliability of Mrs. Redmond's identification calls his conviction into question and demands relief,\" Hooper's attorneys said in the latest appeal.The other two men convicted in the case died before their sentences could be carried out.The Arizona Supreme Court ruled last month that the state can move forward with Hooper's execution.He would be the third inmate put to death this year after Arizona recently resumed carrying out executions.There are 111 inmates on Arizona's death row and 22 have exhausted their appeals, according to the Attorney General's Office.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek)PLZEN, Czech Republic (AP) -- It was a meaningless win to close out a disappointing Champions League campaign for Barcelona.Barcelona finished the group stage with a 4-2 win at Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday, a result that did little to cushion the blow of the Catalan club's second consecutive early exit in the European competition.\"The overall evaluation of our group campaign has to be negative,\" Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez said. \"We had qualification in our own hands and didn't manage it. We didn't take our opportunities.\" Barcelona had already been eliminated in advance, while Plzen knew it had finished last in Group C. Barcelona ended the group stage with seven points in third place, guaranteed of a spot in the Europa League playoffs.\"Now we are candidates for the Europa League,\" said Xavi, who didn't use all of his regular starters on Tuesday. \"It's a beautiful competition and we will fight to win it.\"Last season, Barcelona was eliminated from the second-tier competition by eventual champion Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarterfinals.Ferran Torres scored twice and Marcos Alonso and teenager Pablo Torre grabbed a goal each for the Catalan club on Tuesday. The hosts got on the board with a pair of goals by Tomas Chory. Barcelona's only other group-stage victory had been 5-1 against Plzen in their opener. It then lost 2-0 at Bayern Munich and 1-0 at Inter Milan, which both advanced to the next round. Bayern beat Inter 2-0 at home on Tuesday for its six straight victory in the group.A 3-3 draw at home against Inter then meant Barcelona needed the Italian team to stumble in its final matches, which didn't happen. Barcelona also lost 3-0 at home to Bayern.It was the first time since 1999 that Barcelona failed to advance to the knockout stage in consecutive years, coinciding with the departure of Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain two seasons ago.This season's failure to advance was a humbling setback after Barcelona went on a spending spree to boost its squad in the hope of recovering some of that money with a deep run in the European competition. But not even the addition of the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha were enough in the Champions League.Lewandowski was not in the squad on Tuesday because of a minor back issue. Midfielders Franck Kessie and Torre were substituted during the match because of injuries.Barcelona has its focus on the Spanish league, where it trails Real Madrid by one point at the top of the standings. It has won 10 of its first 12 league matches. Plzen finished its campaign with six losses. It was outscored 24-5 by its opponents.\"It was really tough group and I have to say we did not expect it to be as difficult,\" Plzen goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek said.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Sven Hoppe/dpa via AP)MUNICH (AP) -- Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting extended his rich scoring form for Bayern Munich as the German champion beat Inter Milan 2-0 on Tuesday to complete the Champions League group stage with a perfect record of six wins.Both teams had already secured a spot in the last 16, with Inter finishing second in Group C behind Bayern. Choupo-Moting hit a rising shot into the top-left corner from outside the penalty area for Bayern's second goal, taking the Cameroon striker to seven goals in his last six games in all competitions. Choupo-Moting also had an overhead kick goal disallowed for offside shortly before.Coach Julian Nagelsmann's decision to use the longtime backup as a starting striker has helped bring about a seven-game winning run for Bayern since mid-October and has given the team a focus in attack following Robert Lewandowski's departure to Barcelona at the end of last season.Inter was aggrieved at referee Ivan Kruzliak's decision not to give a penalty early on when Sadio Mane blocked a shot with his hands in front of his face. After consulting a video replay, Kruzliak indicated that he decided against a penalty because Mane was acting instinctively to protect himself.Benjamin Pavard opened the scoring for Bayern with a header when he was left in space in front of goal at a corner in the 32nd minute. That came just after Lautaro Martinez missed an excellent chance to give Inter the lead, sending the ball over the bar from close range as he stretched to meet a cross from Robin Gosens. After that, the closest Inter came to a goal was when Kristjan Asllani put the ball into the net from a clearly offside position at a free kick soon after the break.With Bayern in full control of the game following Choupo-Moting's goal, Nagelsmann opted to give game time off the bench to two promising youngsters, 17-year-old striker Mathys Tel and 16-year-old midfielder Paul Wanner. Edin Dzeko had a shot saved by Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich in stoppage time.Bayern is the only team this season to achieve six wins from six games in the group stage after the only other team to win all of its first five games, Napoli, was beaten 2-0 by Liverpool on Tuesday.In the other group game, third-place Barcelona beat Viktoria Plzen 4-2.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Armando Franca)LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Eintracht Frankfurt's fortunes changed in a matter of minutes in the Champions League on Tuesday.At one moment it was finishing last in its group, the next it was qualifying to the knockout stage. Frankfurt scored two goals 10 minutes apart in the second half to come from behind to defeat Sporting Lisbon 2-1 and advance from the group stage in its first appearance in the European competition.Kolo Muani scored the winner with an angled shot from inside the area in the 72nd minute. Arthur Gomes had put the hosts ahead in the 39th and Frankfurt equalized with a penalty kick converted by Daichi Kamada in the 62nd. \"Our first half wasn't good,\" Frankfurt coach Oliver Glasner said. \"I asked more of the lads and they just delivered.\"Sporting was leading Group D while it was winning at home, but it finished in third place to earn a spot in the Europa League playoffs. A draw would have been enough for it to advance regardless of other results.\"It's a tough blow for us,\" Sporting defender Sebastian Coates said. \"But we have to move on and keep working.\"The Portuguese side was trying to make it to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the second straight season. It was eliminated by Manchester City in the last 16 last season.Sporting started the game one point behind Tottenham, which scored late to win 2-1 at Marseille and finish first in what had been a wide-open Group D entering the last round. Marseille ended in last place. A draw would have given the French club a spot in the Europa League playoffs at the expense of Sporting.Frankfurt is making its Champions League debut this season thanks to its Europa League title last season.Sporting was trying to become the third Portuguese club to advance to the last 16 this season, after Benfica and Porto had already secured their spots in the next round.Sporting lost forward Nuno Santos because of an injury in the first half.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- While they had a need at wide receiver and other positions, general manager Joe Schoen and the New York Giants stayed pat at the trading deadline Tuesday rather than risk future capital for a deal.Speaking minutes after the NFL's deadline passed, Schoen said he was on the phone much of the day discussing deals, but that was nothing different than he has done since the end of August.The former Buffalo Bills assistant general manager said there was one call from a team interested in a current Giants' player, but his response to the offer was \"a hard 'No.'\" He would not identify the player.Heading into their bye week, the Giants have a totally unexpected 6-2 record and they are in position to make the playoffs for the first time since 2016 with nine games left in the regular season.Schoen refused to say whether he felt the Giants should make the playoffs. Much like coach Brian Daboll, he said his focus was on facing Houston on Nov. 13.\"We had several conversations with teams on multiple positions and the price point didn't match up, things just didn't work out,\" Schoen said. \"We were active in phone calls and, you know, trying to improve the roster, which we'll continue to do.\"Schoen said he would sign healthy unrestricted free agents if they could help the team win.While there were no trades, Schoen said the Giants are hopeful that veteran receiver Kenny Golladay can return for the game against Houston, and regain some of his old form.He refused to say much about the recent trade of 2021 first-round pick Kadarius Toney to the Chiefs last week. He said it was in the best interest of the organization.Over the next week, Schoen said he will look into some player contract situations. Quarterback Daniel Jones and running back Saquon Barkley will be at the end of contracts after this season and he is open to talking deals during the off week. He said he also would look at contract extensions for other players.Schoen wants that work done by Monday to avoid any distractions once the team returns from its break.Schoen said the cap situation for next season looks good, unless either more players go on injured reserve or the team has to make practice squad elevations. \"We're 6-2,\" Schoen said. \"You know, we've done a lot of good things. You know, I think everybody agrees there's still some meat on the bone and areas where we can improve. But, you know, we got nine games to go there. There's a long way to go, but I'm pleased with where we are right now.\"More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Chase Claypool (11) warms up before an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)The NFL trade deadline turned into a frenzy with 15 teams making 10 deals involving 12 players and several draft picks on Tuesday.Edge rusher Bradley Chubb, tight end T.J. Hockenson, wide receiver Chase Claypool, suspended wideout Calvin Ridley and running back Nyhiem Hines headlined the list of players switching teams ahead of the 4 p.m. EDT cutoff.Miami bolstered both sides of the ball, acquiring Chubb from Denver and running back Jeff Wilson from San Francisco. The Dolphins (5-3) are trying to catch the AFC-leading Buffalo Bills, who got Hines from Indianapolis.The NFC North-leading Minnesota Vikings (6-1) added Hockenson after placing Irv Smith on injured reserve.Claypool went from Pittsburgh to Chicago, which unloaded linebacker Roquan Smith on Monday. Smith joins the AFC North-leading Baltimore Ravens (5-3). The Steelers then acquired cornerback William Jackson from Washington.The NFC South-leading Atlanta Falcons (4-4) sent Ridley to Jacksonville in a complex deal. Ridley was suspended in March for at least the 2022 season after a league investigation determined he bet on NFL games in 2021 while away from the team addressing mental health concerns. The league said the suspension will carry \"through at least the conclusion of the 2022 season.\"A few teams already made big moves ahead of the deadline. The 49ers (4-4) got star running back Christian McCaffrey from Carolina. That move made Wilson expendable. Wilson, who lead the 49ers with 468 yards rushing, reunites with coach Mike McDaniel in Miami. The Philadelphia Eagles (7-0) acquired three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Robert Quinn from Chicago last week. The New York Jets (5-3) added running back James Robinson from the Jaguars after losing rookie running back Breece Hall to a season-ending knee injury.The AFC West-leading Kansas City Chiefs (5-2) added wide receiver Kadarius Toney from the Giants. Arizona got wideout Robbie Anderson from Carolina.Perhaps most surprising was the lack of activity from the defending Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams. Known for making a splash, the Rams (3-4) stayed put.The 10 trades were a record for the NFL on deadline day.BRONCOS-DOLPHINS: The Dolphins got Chubb and a 2025 fifth-round pick for a first-round draft pick next year, a fourth-rounder in 2024 and running back Chase Edmonds.49ERS-DOLPHINS: The Niners traded Wilson for Miami's 2023 fifth-round draft choice.LIONS-VIKINGS: The Vikings sent a 2023 second-round pick and a 2024 third-round pick to the Lions for Hockenson, a fourth-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2024. STEELERS-BEARS: The Bears acquired Claypool from Pittsburgh for a 2023 second-round draft pick.FALCONS-JAGUARS: The compensation sent from Jacksonville to Atlanta for Ridley ranges between a second-round pick in 2024 and a sixth-rounder, according to a person with knowledge of the trade. The draft pick is contingent on when Ridley gets reinstated, how much he plays in 2023 and whether he signs a long-term deal with the Jaguars.COLTS-BILLS: The Colts acquired running back Zack Moss and a conditional sixth-round selection in 2023 for Hines.COMMANDERS-STEELERS: The Steelers added Jackson and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2025 from Washington for a conditional sixth-rounder that year. FALCONS-BILLS: Buffalo got safety Dean Marlowe from Atlanta for seventh-round selection in 2023.FALCONS-CHIEFS: The Falcons acquired cornerback Rashad Fenton from Kansas City for a 2023 conditional seventh-round pick. BRONCOS-JETS: The Broncos got defensive end Jacob Martin and a fifth-round selection in 2024 for a 2024 fourth-round pick.

Here's a brief look at what's on the ballot: Ratification of the Constitution of Alabama of 2022:Voters will decide whether to ratify a recompiled Alabama Constitution. The recompiled document deletes racist language and repealed provisions. It also reorganizes the sprawling document. The changes are designed to remove the lingering stain of the state's segregationist past and make the document more user friendly. Amendment 1 - Bail restriction The measure is aimed at giving judges more discretion to deny bail to people charged with violent crimes. It adds murder, kidnapping, rape and other offenses to the list of crimes for which bail can be denied. The measure is named Aniah's Law after 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard, who was killed in 2019 after being abducted from an Auburn gas station. Amendment 2 - Broadband funding The amendment is part of the state's effort to expand broadband access. It clarifies that local governments can grant federal funds or other state funding to a public or private organization to expand access to high-speed internet infrastructure. Amendment 3 - Death sentence commutations The amendment would require the governor to provide notice to the attorney general and the victim's family before commuting a death sentence. Only one sentence has been commuted since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Gov. Fob James in 1999 commuted Judith Ann Neelley's sentence to life in prison.Amendment 4 - Election procedures The amendment would prevent lawmakers from making election procedure changes within six months of an election. This amendment requires any legislation affecting how a general election is held to take effect at least six months before the election.Amendment 5 - Delete outdated reference Deletes the outdated phrase \"orphans' business\" in regards to a probate judges' duties. The amendment only removes the wording. Judges would continue to handle adoptions and guardianships. Amendment 6 - Local government projects This amendment says cities and towns that collect a special property tax may use those tax dollars to directly \"pay-as-you-go\" for construction projects instead of going into debt.Amendment 7 - Economic development This amendment is aimed at giving local governments more power to issue economic development incentives. It would clarify all local governments can use public funds to sell public property, lend their credit, or become indebted for economic development purposes. Amendment 8 and Amendment 9 - Local sewer projects These amendments would bring certain privately owned sewer systems, at least temporarily, under regulation by the Public Service Commission. Amendment 8 applies only to Shelby County. Amendment 9 applies only to the town of Lake View in Tuscaloosa and Jefferson Counties. Amendment 10 - Companion to new constitution ratification This is a companion amendment to the ratification vote. If the new constitution is ratified, it would allow any new amendments to be placed within the document, instead of just listed at the end. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole)MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- Tottenham advanced in the Champions League the hard way on Tuesday.With manager Antonio Conte serving a suspension in the stands and one of its star players, Son Heung-min, forced off the field with a head injury, Tottenham was trailing 1-0 at halftime against Marseille and heading out of the competition.So bad was the performance, Spurs didn't have a touch in Marseille's penalty area in the first half.They managed to turn it around.Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scored with the last kick of the game at Stade Velodrome for a goal that sealed a 2-1 win and lifted Tottenham to the top of Group D above Eintracht Frankfurt, which had already clinched victory at Sporting -- also 2-1 -- and was sitting in first place until Hojbjerg's goal.That goal also meant Marseille finished in last place and will have no involvement in European competition in the new year.\"We could feel in the first half a team was playing without the fear to lose -- it was Marseille,\" Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris said. \"And in the second half, we had a team that was fearing to lose -- and it was us.\"Marseille had to win to advance to the knockout stage for the first time since the 2011-12 season and dominated the first half, penning the visitors in their own half and finally taking the lead in stoppage time when Chancel Mbemba headed in unmarked at the far post after a quickly taken corner.Tottenham's players barely strung any passes together in the first half -- defender Clement Lenglet later acknowledged he and his teammates were confused about how to approach the game -- and received a blow when a dazed-looking Son was helped off the field after receiving a shoulder to his face by Mbemba. The forward, who is set to play at the World Cup for South Korea, appeared to be unsteady on his feet.Starting the second half with a purpose -- needing to score -- helped Tottenham, which quickly gained a foothold and Lenglet headed home a 54th-minute equalizer by glancing in Ivan Perisic's left-wing free kick. The pressure was back on Marseille.In a nervy final 15 minutes, Hojbjerg struck the crossbar for Tottenham before, at the other end, Alexis Sanchez's goalbound shot was deflected wide off the body of Perisic.Marseille's team contained four players who have played for Tottenham's fierce rival, Arsenal, and one them -- Sead Kolasinac -- entered as a substitute and had a golden chance in the 87th minute to put the hosts ahead. Found by a cross to the far post, Kolasinac headed wide from barely two meters out.Marseille's players poured forward in search of a winner, much to the annoyance of its animated coach, Igor Tudor. He ended up straying onto the field of play in a bid to get across a message that a draw -- which would have secured third place and spot in the Europa League's qualifying playoffs -- would actually have been fine.\"The players couldn't hear it because it was so loud,\" Tudor said. \"There was confusion at the end. Unfortunately, it cost us.\"Indeed, Tudor was on the playing surface as Tottenham broke forward in the fifth minute of stoppage time, with Harry Kane playing through Hojbjerg to crash a shot in off the post.Conte watched the game in the stands as a result of his red card in last week's draw against Sporting. He was mostly unmoved until the late goal, which brought out a wild celebration by Conte.When Tottenham got to the Champions League final in 2019, the team only made it out of the group stage thanks to a late equalizer by Lucas Moura against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the final round of games.Spurs have been making slow starts to matches in this year's group stage, too. Still, they are through, completing a clean sweep of English teams in the last 16.\"It was very difficult in the first half,\" said Tottenham assistant coach Cristian Stellini, filling in for Conte on the touchline. \"And in the difficulties we didn't lose our minds, we stayed in the match.\"AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has quietly ended his litigation challenging the constitutionality of a powerful state commission that scrutinizes state agency rules, days before it was heading to court. Cooper's private attorneys filed paperwork last Friday dismissing his August 2020 lawsuit against Republican legislative leaders. A hearing before three trial judges on the governor's motion to have the composition of the 10-member Rules Review Commission struck down as unconstitutional was scheduled for Nov. 9. Cooper's lawsuit alleged that a governor \"lacks no meaningful control over\" the commission because all of its members are picked by legislative leaders -- five each by the recommendation of the House speaker and Senate president pro tempore -- even though it acts like an executive branch agency. The lawsuit didn't focus on a specific action by the commission, which decides whether to approve or reject temporary or permanent agency rules to carry out the details of state law. Rather, it examined broadly the commission's actions in recent years and asked for a broad ruling throwing out the law. The lawsuit was dismissed \"without prejudice,\" which means Cooper could sue over the issue again -- something that Cooper spokesperson Mary Scott Winstead could occur. Cooper's office and the executive branch \"will consider a future challenge to a specific decision by the Rules Review Commission that unlawfully blocks executive action, and the governor will continue to guard against legislative overreach that hurts the people of North Carolina,\" Winstead said Tuesday. Cooper has filed several lawsuits against Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger that challenge legislative action, including laws that took effect just before he took office in early 2017. The results have been mixed for the competing parties.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced an eco-activist to community service but no extra time in custody, rejecting the government's call for a yearslong prison term for the Seattle man related to arsons decades ago. Joseph Dibee, 54, was a fugitive for more than a decade. In April, Dibee pleaded guilty to the 1997 arson of a slaughterhouse in central Oregon that butchered wild horses and sold the meat in Europe. He also pleaded to the 2001 arson of a Bureau of Land Management wild horse corral in Litchfield, California. As part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors dropped arson charges in Washington state.He told U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken Monday by video in federal court in Eugene that he was truly sorry, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. \"I haven't been involved in this type of activity for many years,\" Dibee told the judge. \"I've moved on with my life. It was a mistake many years ago -- many, many years ago -- and I paid a really heavy price for it.\"Assistant U.S. Attorney Quinn Harrington sought a prison term of more than seven years, arguing Dibee shouldn't be \"rewarded with a lower sentence after fleeing accountability.\"Dibee took more of a leadership role in igniting fires when some of his co-defendants served more as lookouts, Harrington said.Defense lawyer Matthew Schindler argued for a sentence of time-served -- the two years and five months Dibee spent in jail. During that time, a white supremacist broke Dibee's jaw, permanently disfiguring him, and Dibee was the first to contract COVID-19 in Multnomah County's Inverness Jail, his lawyer said.Aiken, who has been with the case since the start, said she believed Dibee has recognized his wrongs. She remains impressed with his work now to use his \"incredible engineering skills\" to help Indigenous tribes in Alaska, she said.Since his release from jail to care for his terminally-ill father, Dibee has not violated any of his supervision conditions, the judge said.She ordered him to complete 1,000 hours of community service in the next three years and pay about 1.3 million in restitution, an amount shared by his co-defendants.Federal investigators said Dibee was part of the largest group of eco-saboteurs ever taken down by the FBI. They called themselves \"The Family\" -- more than a dozen people who committed crimes in the name of the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front -- and caused an estimated 40 million in damage from 1996 to 2005.Dibee was eventually tracked down in Cuba in August 2018.He's the 12th person to be sentenced. One alleged group member, Josephine Sunshine Overaker, is still listed on a FBI terrorism most wanted list.

All Rights Reserved.RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks released cornerback Sidney Jones on Tuesday shortly after the NFL trade deadline passed. Jones started 11 games last season and played well in those opportunities for the Seahawks. He was expected to be a starter this year, but injuries opened opportunities for others during training camp and rookie Tariq Woolen and Michael Jackson established themselves as the starters for the Seahawks. Seattle expects to get promising second-year cornerback Tre Brown back in the next couple of weeks, and Jones' chances of seeing the field were going to be even more limited. Jones was a second-round pick by Philadelphia in 2017. He also spent one season in Jacksonville. Seattle also released wide receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside from the practice squad and signed wide receiver Laquon Treadwell to the practice squad. Arcega-Whiteside was acquired by trade from Philadelphia during training camp but didn't appear in a game for Seattle. Treadwell was a first-round pick by Minnesota in 2016.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)John McVay, the executive who helped launch the San Francisco 49ers dynasty and grandfather of Rams coach Sean McVay, has died. He was 91.The 49ers announced Tuesday that McVay had died. They did not give a cause of death.McVay spent 22 seasons with the 49ers starting in 1979 in various capacities. He played an integral role along with coach Bill Walsh in building one of the league's greatest dynasties that won five Super Bowl titles in a span of 14 seasons.\"This is a very sad day for our organization and the entire football community,\" the team said in a statement. \"John McVay was a driving force in constructing teams for our five Super Bowl titles. Most importantly, John was a Hall of Fame person who built genuine and sincere relationships with front office staff, coaches and players. John's commitment and contributions to the 49ers created the standard and tradition we strive to carry on today. Our thoughts and prayers are with the McVay family.\" McVay was inducted into the 49ers Hall of Fame in 2013, and the team dedicated its draft room as the \"John McVay Draft Room\" in his honor in 2016. McVay originally joined the Niners in 1979 with Walsh as the director of player personnel. Over the next 17 seasons he had various titles including general manager and director of football operations. He played a role in building the NFL's model organization with players like Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Steve Young. McVay was named The Sporting News NFL Executive of the Year in 1989 following the team's fourth Super Bowl title. After retiring following the 1995 season, he later re-joined the organization officially in 1999 and served as vice president and director of football operations through the 2003 season.Before joining the 49ers, McVay was the head coach of the Giants for two-plus seasons. He had a 14-23 record for New York and his most memorable game featured a late fumble by Joe Pisarcik when the Giants could have kneeled out the clock. Herm Edwards returned it for a winning TD for Philadelphia in a 19-17 win on Nov. 19, 1978, that is now known as the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands.\"McVay's grandson, Sean, followed him into the NFL and became head coach of the Niners' NFC West rival, the Los Angeles Rams in 2017. Sean McVay has been to two Super Bowls and won his first title and the sixth for the family last season. \"John was such an instrumental influence on Sean and his leadership qualities permeate our entire organization through the relationship he had with his grandson,\" the Rams said in a statement. \"John's legacy will live on forever and the marks he left on his family, our league, and our game will never be forgotten.\" AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saudi Arabia has shared intelligence with American officials that suggests Iran could be preparing for an imminent attack on the kingdom, three U.S. officials said Tuesday.The heightened concerns about a potential attack on Saudi Arabia come as the Biden administration is criticizing Tehran for its crackdown on widespread protests and condemning it for sending hundreds of drones -- as well as technical support -- to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine.\"We are concerned about the threat picture, and we remain in constant contact through military and intelligence channels with the Saudis,\" the National Security Council said in a statement. \"We will not hesitate to act in the defense of our interests and partners in the region.\"Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's mission to the United Nations told The Associated Press on Wednesday the U.S. claims are \"baseless.\"\"Western and Zionist regimes spread biased news aimed at creating a negative mood towards the Islamic Republic of Iran and destroying the current positive trends with regional countries,\" the mission said in a statement.One of the officials who confirmed the intelligence sharing described it as a credible threat of an attack \"soon or within 48 hours.\" No U.S. embassy or consulate in the region has issued alerts or guidance to Americans in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East based on the intelligence. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Asked about reports of the intelligence shared by the Saudis, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said U.S. military officials \"are concerned about the threat situation in the region.\"\"We're in regular contact with our Saudi partners, in terms of what information they may have to provide on that front,\" Ryder said. \"But what we've said before, and I'll repeat it, is that we will reserve the right to protect and defend ourselves no matter where our forces are serving, whether in Iraq or elsewhere.\"State Department spokesperson Ned Price said America was \"concerned about the threat picture,\" without elaborating. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the Saudis sharing the intelligence earlier on Tuesday. Iran has alleged without providing evidence that Saudi Arabia and other rivals are fomenting the dissent on its streets by ordinary Iranians.Of particular ire is protest coverage by Iran International, a London-based, Farsi-language satellite news channel once majority-owned by a Saudi national.The U.S. and Saudis blamed Iran in 2019 of being behind a major attack in eastern Saudi Arabia, which halved the oil-rich kingdom's production and caused energy prices to spike. The Iranians denied they were behind the attack, but the same triangle-shaped, bomb-carrying drones used in that attack are now being deployed by Russian forces in their war on Ukraine.The Saudis have also been hit repeatedly in recent years by drones, missiles and mortars launched by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to battle the Houthis in 2015 and has been internationally criticized for its airstrikes in the war, which have killed scores of civilians.In recent weeks, the Biden administration has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials for the brutal crackdown on demonstrators after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September after her arrest by Iran's morality police. The administration has also hit Iran with sanctions for supplying drones to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine.At least 288 people have been killed and 14,160 arrested during the protests, according to the group Human Rights Activists in Iran. Demonstrations have continued, even as the feared paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has warned young Iranians to stop.Iran already launched a series of attacks targeting Kurdish separatist positions in northern Iraq amid the protests, killing at least 16 people, including an American citizen.U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia have also been strained after the Riyadh-led alliance of oil producing nations, OPEC, announced in October that it would cut production by 2 million barrels per day starting in November.The White House has said it is reviewing its relationship with the Saudis over the move. The administration said the production cut is effectively helping another OPEC member, Russia, pad its coffers as it continues its war in Ukraine, now in its ninth month. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday reiterated that the administration remains concerned that Iran may also provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles.\"We haven't seen that concern bear out, but it's a concern we have,\" Kirby said.Even as the U.S. and others raise concerns about possible Iranian action, the administration has not ruled out the possibility of reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which was brokered by the Obama administration and scrapped in 2018 by the Trump administration.The U.S. special envoy to Iran, Robert Malley, said on Monday that the administration was not currently focused on the deal, which has been stalled since August.Still, Malley refused to declare the deal dead and said the administration \"makes no apology\" for \"trying to do everything we can to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\"The deal had provided Tehran with billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program. It includes caps on enrichment and how much material Iran can stockpile and limits the operation of advanced centrifuges needed to enrich.Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- One of the Big Ten's top defensive players and three other Michigan State football players were suspended Tuesday for their roles in the melee in the Michigan Stadium tunnel.Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller and coach Mel Tucker announced the latest suspensions in a statement, bringing the total number of suspended players to eight.The players suspended Tuesday were defensive end-linebacker Jacoby Windmon, cornerbacks Malcolm Jones and Justin White and defensive end Brandon Wright. Haller and Tucker said the disciplinary action was taken as the school continues to review electronic evidence of the postgame events Saturday night in the long and narrow tunnel leading from the field to the home and visitor locker rooms.Windmon, who joined the Spartans this season after playing the previous three at UNLV, leads the Big Ten with 10 1/2 tackles for loss and is tied for second with 5 1/2 sacks. His five forced fumbles are most in the nation.Windmon started six games at defensive end and the last two at linebacker. He has been named conference defensive player of the week three times.Michigan State on Sunday announced the suspensions of linebacker Tank Brown, safety Angelo Grose, defensive end Zion Young and cornerback Khary Crump.The Spartans play at No. 14 Illinois this Saturday.Scuffles broke out in the tunnel after the fourth-ranked Wolverines beat the Spartans 29-7. Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said defensive back Gemon Green was punched by a Spartans player in the tunnel to spark the fracas and that teammate Ja'Den McBurrows was attacked when he tried to help.McBurrows is seen on a video shared on social media being pushed, punched and kicked by multiple Michigan State players, who pulled him out of the tunnel and into a hallway that doesn't lead to either locker room.Harbaugh said both players have injuries, adding he did not know if Green, a starting cornerback for a third straight season, would be cleared to play Saturday night at Rutgers.Brown, Grose and Young are seen on video getting physical with McBurrows. Windmon is seen on video being involved in the altercation with Green.McBurrows and Green went up the tunnel, walking alongside the Spartans, after the game while much of Michigan's team was waving them off the field after beating its in-state rival for the first time in three years.\"We are transparently working with law enforcement and the Big Ten Conference to evaluate additional facts and evidence surrounding the events in Ann Arbor,\" the MSU statement said. \"We will continue to take appropriate action in this matter as we learn more. The student-athlete suspensions will remain in place until the investigations are completed.\"It was the second straight game at Michigan that included an altercation in the tunnel. Michigan players said Penn State players threw peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at them as the teams headed to the locker room at halftime of a close game the Wolverines ultimately won in a 41-17 rout on Oct. 15.AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.

All Rights Reserved.LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Romano L. Mazzoli, a Democrat who represented Louisville and its suburbs in Congress for 12 terms before retiring in 1994, died Tuesday in Louisville. He was 89.Mazzoli was elected from the 3rd District to his first term in November 1970 and held memberships on the House Judiciary Committee, the House Small Business Committee and various subcommittees. A federal building in downtown Louisville is named for him.Retiring Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth, who is ending his eighth term in the 3rd District, said when faced with a dilemma, he would often ask himself what Mazzoli would have done.\"I could never adequately express what his friendship and support has meant to me during my political career,\" Yarmuth said in a statement Tuesday.Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, noted Mazzoli's work on immigration reform and his post-congressional career teaching at the University of Louisville's law school.\"I know I join with a chorus of former colleagues, students, and friends in saying he will truly be missed,\" McConnell said.Mazzoli accepted no political action committee contributions, limited contributions to 100 rather than the 1,000 limit and spent a relatively paltry 170,000 to win his 12th term in 1992.In the 1980s, he co-authored major immigration legislation that passed in Congress. His father immigrated from Italy as an 11-year-old and in a 2008 naturalization event, urged the country's newest citizens to \"create your own chapter of the American dream. Live that life well and full.\"Mazzoli said then that the majority of immigrants entering the country are like his forefathers -- hard working and willing to sacrifice for their children. He said the number of immigrants entering illegally are in the minority.He said those cases tend to \"rile people up,\" deterring Congress from passing \"reasonable, sensible and compassionate\" immigration legislation in recent years.Mazzoli's political career began with his election to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967. Born in Louisville on Nov. 2, 1932, Mazzoli graduated in 1954 from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in business administration. He served two years of active duty in the U.S. Army. In 1960, he graduated first in his class from the University of Louisville School of Law and joined the law department of the Louisville  Nashville Railroad Co. Mazzoli entered private law practice in 1962 and from 1964 to 1968, he lectured in business law at Bellarmine College in Louisville.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.DOVER, Del. (AP) -- The former president of the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has reached a settlement with federal securities regulators in a related civil action.In a court filing Tuesday, an attorney for the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge in Delaware to approve a consent judgment against former Wilmington Trust President Robert Harra Jr.Under the proposed consent judgment, Harra would pay a civil penalty of 100,000, be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and be prohibited from violating federal securities laws that were the basis of the SEC's civil suit.Harra, along with former Wilmington Trust Chief Financial Officer David Gibson, former Chief Credit Officer William North and former controller Kevyn Rakowski, were convicted in 2018 on criminal charges of fraud, conspiracy and making false statements regarding the bank's troubled commercial loan portfolio.The bank itself also was criminally charged but reached a 60 million settlement with prosecutors just as a trial was set to start. Wilmington Trust's settlement included a civil forfeiture of 44 million and 16 million it previously paid to the SEC.The executives received prison sentences ranging from three to six years, but a federal appeals court panel last year reversed their convictions for making false statements and ordered that judgments of acquittals be entered. The panel also ordered a retrial of the conspiracy and securities fraud charges, but prosecutors later opted to drop the case altogether.Meanwhile, Gibson and Rakowski finalized settlements in the SEC's civil action in 2019, agreeing to pay more than 70,000 and 44,000, respectively, to the agency. Approval of Harra's settlement would leave North the only defendant in the lawsuit, in which SEC claimed the executives knowingly or recklessly made false disclosures regarding the bank's loan portfolio. An attorney for North did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.In a separate civil action, Wilmington Trust agreed to pay 200 million cash to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging fraudulent concealment of billions of dollars in bad loans. Auditing firm KPMG agreed to pay an additional 10 million as part of the settlement.In the criminal case, prosecutors alleged that in the wake of the financial crisis, the executives misled regulators and investors about Wilmington Trust's massive amount of past-due commercial real estate loans before the bank was hastily sold in 2011 while bordering on collapse. Founded by members of the DuPont family in 1903, the bank imploded despite receiving 330 million from the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.Prosecutors said bank officials waived millions of dollars in matured loans from reporting requirements if they were designated as \"current for interest\" and in the process of being extended. To ensure that loans well past their repayment dates were purportedly exempt from reporting requirements, the bank lent even more money to struggling developers just to make the interest payments.In the fourth quarter of 2009, bank officials reported only 10.8 million in commercial loans as 90 days or more past due, concealing more than 316 million in past-due loans subject to the waiver practice, according to prosecutors. After a meeting to discuss matured loans and \"how to make them go away\" by year's end, bank officials went beyond the waiver practice and decided on a mass extension that involved temporarily extending more than 800 commercial loans worth 1.3 billion, prosecutors said. In an email to Harra, North referred to certain loans as \"credit turds.\"Meanwhile, before its 2011 fire sale to MT Bank, Wilmington Trust raised 287 million in a 2010 stock offering, intended partly to help repay the TARP funds, while hiding the truth about its shaky financial condition from investors, prosecutors said.Defense attorneys argued that the waiver practice had been in place for decades and was no secret. They also maintained that instructions for filing reports with the Federal Reserve and for disclosing financial information in SEC filings were ambiguous, and that the term \"past due\" was not clearly defined. The appeals court agreed that the reporting requirements were ambiguous.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Ajak won the match 3-1. (AP Photo/Scott Heppell)GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Rangers was left with an unwanted group-stage record in the Champions League after losing 3-1 at home to Ajax on Tuesday, which secured a place in the Europa League's qualifying playoffs.Rangers finished Group A with six straight losses and a goal difference of minus 20 -- the worst group stage record ever.On another damaging European night for the Scottish team, Steven Berghuis put the Dutch champions ahead in the fourth minute before Mohammed Kudus added a second in the 29th.Rangers captain James Tavernier scored a late penalty but substitute Francisco Conceicao soon restored the visitors' two-goal lead. The win sealed third place in the group for Ajax, whose two victories both came against Rangers.The previous worst group-stage record was held by Dinamo Zagreb, which lost all six games and finished with a goal difference of minus 19 in 2011-12.Rangers will be glad the punishment is over in its first Champions League campaign in 12 years.It needed a win by five goals or more to drop into the Europa League but even the most fervent Rangers supporters dismissed that possibility.Putting together a team was a challenge itself for coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who had midfielder John Lundstram suspended and nine players injured.Former Rangers defender Calvin Bassey was in a strong Ajax side that struck first to dampen the early home optimism. Kudus set up Berghuis to beat goalkeeper Allan McGregor from the edge of the box with a deft chip.It already looked ominous for Rangers -- McGregor had to backtrack to grab a lob from Berghuis from under his crossbar -- but the under-strength home side eventually composed themselves and went in search of a leveler.In the 13th minute, the covering Bassey headed Fashion Sakala's header off the line after good work by winger Ryan Kent to get his cross in from the left.However, another lapse in concentration allowed Ajax to extend its lead, this time Owen Wijndal the provider for Kudus, whose deflected shot came off teenage defender Leon King to beat McGregor.The keeper pulled off a fine save from Steven Bergwijn minutes later and the first boos of frustration from the stands came soon afterward when Kudus fired an effort just wide of the far post.Kudus had the ball in the net in the 55th minute following a sweeping move but Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg ruled it out for offside after a VAR check.A terrific shot on the turn by Scott Arfield in the 70th minute was tipped over the bar by the under-employed Ajax keeper Remko Pasveer but the corner was defended.In the 84th minute, Morelos took advantage of a mistake by Pasveer but failed to hit the target with the goal gaping.Moments later, Rangers substitute Rabbi Matondo, on for Kent, was brought down by Edson Alvarez inside the box and Tavernier converted the penalty.However, Conceicao, only on the field for a minute, scored from close range and referee Nyberg soon blew his whistle to signal the end of a campaign that goes down in history for all the wrong reasons for the Glasgow club.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jon Super)LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Not for the first time, the Champions League is proving a haven for Liverpool. A 2-0 win against Napoli on Tuesday ended the Italians' unbeaten start to the season and served as a reminder of what Jurgen Klopp's team is still capable of. After back-to-back losses in the Premier League against relegation-fighting Nottingham Forest and Leeds, Liverpool did what no other team has been capable of by inflicting defeat on Napoli.Late goals from Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez decided a match that was short on entertainment or chances. And it was a result that was of little consequence to the group standings, with both teams assured of qualification to the round of 16 before kick off and Napoli still progressing as Group A winners. But that will be of no concern to Klopp, who is looking to boost the confidence of his players wherever he can, such has been Liverpool's inconsistency this term. \"I don't think anyone doubts the quality, but that is part of the problem as well,\" Klopp said. \"So we don't show it consistently.\"We are Liverpool, a top team. Nobody forgot what we did last year, the boys didn't forget that, but it's now not important. People might get sick of it when I say, but we now really have to fight through and then in that moment the football has a good chance to come back, the real football that we can play.\"It will take more than one win to dispel the doubts surrounding Liverpool. Especially coming in the Champions League - a competition that has so often provided form-defying performances from a club that has won it on six occasions and reached the final in three of the last five seasons under Klopp.Such have been Liverpool's troubles this season that Klopp was pushed to declare on the eve of this match that he was not in need of a break. The German has faced increasing questions over whether he has taken the team as far as he can following the departure of Sadio Mane, while key players appear to have passed their peak.Yet this is still a team that beat Manchester City last month and has won five out of six in the group stage of the Champions League. Victory halted a Napoli team that has been the big story in Europe this season, with the Italian league leader's 4-1 rout of Liverpool in September a calling card of a performance against one of Europe's true elite. Liverpool had been flattered by that result, which could have been even more humiliating. Napoli's ascent has come with a swaggering brand of soccer under head coach Luciano Spalletti.This game represented another opportunity for the team to confirm its emergence as a major contender for the Champions League. But the visitors were largely subdued, rarely threatening in a first half that befitted a game with so little at stake. Curtis Jones lifted one early close-range effort over the bar from a tight angle for Liverpool, while Thiago Alcantara forced Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret into a save with a shot from just inside the box.The deadlock looked to have been broken early in the second half when Leo Ostigard headed in Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's cross, only for it to be ruled out for offside after a lengthy VAR check. That moment at least livened up the crowd and Napoli improved as an attacking force, with Kvaratskhelia presented with a chance to score, only to misconnect with a volley that bobbled tamely towards Alisson.As the game drifted toward what appeared to be a stalemate Salah stabbed an effort straight at Meret from inside the box. It proved to be a warning of what was to come, with Salah forcing the ball over the line in the 85th after a goalmouth scramble. As Napoli went in search of an equalizer, space opened up for Liverpool to exploit and deep into injury time Nunez poked in a second that was eventually given after a VAR check. \"We were playing a giant like Liverpool at Anfield, I can only say well done to my players,\" Spalletti said. \"But if I am being pedantic and we look at the last 10 minutes, the players felt we had reached our objective. It is highly unlikely Liverpool will score the number of goals to top the group and our level dropped a bit. Perhaps that is part of our character.\"Still, no team in the knockout stages will want to play a Napoli side that has proven itself one of the most fearsome forces in Europe. The same goes for Liverpool, which, where the Champions League is concerned, still seems capable of anything.

Huh, File)LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Ryan Poles thought he inherited a potential cornerstone player for the defense in linebacker Roquan Smith when the Chicago Bears hired him as their general manager in January.A contract standoff that heated up during training camp led to a trade demand and ultimately Smith getting sent to Baltimore -- and the deal still stinging a day later.\"There's part of me that's bummed because this was a guy I thought was gonna be here a long time,\" Poles said Tuesday. \"I felt like we put a lot of effort forward to get that done, and we came up short and we couldn't find common ground.\"The Bears sent Smith to the Ravens for second- and fifth-round picks in the 2023 draft as well as linebacker linebacker A.J. Klein on Monday. It was their second major trade involving a defensive player in less than a week after dealing three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Robert Quinn to Philadelphia.Chicago pulled off another move prior to Tuesday's trade deadline, acquiring receiver Chase Claypool from the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Bears' second-round pick in 2023. They gave quarterback Justin Fields a downfield threat who could help balance their offense. The Bears lead the NFL in rushing and rank last in passing.The headliner the past two days was the Smith trade. And the events leading up to it were well-documented.The Bears and Smith hoped to strike a new deal in the offseason with his rookie contract set to expire after this year. He participated in voluntary and mandatory offseason workouts. But once training camp start, things really became heated.Smith, who does not have an agent, opted to \"hold in.\" That allowed him to attend meetings and practices without participating in drills. He went public with a trade request and accused Poles of negotiating in bad faith by making take-it-or-leave-it offers. Smith started practicing on Aug. 20, though he made it clear he wasn't happy about the situation. He did not play in any preseason games. But despite that, he is leading the NFL in tackles.Maybe the outcome would have been different if Smith had an agent to handle negotiations and serve as a buffer between him and the organization. Poles acknowledged dealing directly with a player was awkward.\"It does make it (pause) just harder,\" he said. Poles said the Bears made their final offer to Smith before the season. They just weren't able to bridge the gap.\"We had a difference in value,\" Poles said. \"I'm not going to go into exactly where he slots and all of that. But at the same time, you want players to think highly of themselves. You want them to understand that they are the best at their position. I don't fault him for that. But we had that conversation and obviously, it just didn't work out.\"As for Claypool? The Bears thought it was better to strike now rather than wait, with an underwhelming class of free agent receivers hitting the market after the season.\"You have to do a little bit of forecasting and looking down the road,\" Poles said. \"I just didn't feel completely comfortable with that. Not to say that there's not good players there.\"Fields is also starting to look more comfortable in the offense lately, with the Bears moving the pocket more and calling designed runs. He has a big target added to the mix in the 6-foot-4 Claypool.Claypool has 32 receptions for 311 yards and one touchdown this season for the Steelers. He also threw the first touchdown pass of his career in last week's loss to Philadelphia with a short flip to fullback Derek Watt on a gadget play.But his production has slipped this year. He also became expendable, dropping to third on the depth chart with rookie George Pickens emerging as Pittsburgh's No. 2 receiver behind Diontae Johnson.Claypool made a big impact for the Steelers after they drafted the Notre Dame product in the second round in 2020. He had nine touchdown catches and ran for two more scores as a rookie, helping Pittsburgh win the AFC North. But he has just three TDs since then.\"You can never have enough weapons and guys that help your quarterback gain confidence,\" Poles said. \"I know a lot of the guys are starting to make plays for us. Adding another receiver is going to allow (Fields) to continue to grow and gain that confidence.\"AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gov. Henry McMaster has asked President Joe Biden to authorize a disaster declaration to help with Hurricane Ian recovery efforts in South Carolina, his office said Tuesday.The South Carolina Emergency Management Division and the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that 17 homes were destroyed, 232 homes had major damage and 82 had minor damage because of the storm which came ashore near Georgetown on Sept. 30 with much weaker winds than when it crossed Florida's Gulf Coast earlier that week. Still, the storm left many areas of Charleston's downtown peninsula under water. It also washed away parts of four piers along the coast, including two at Myrtle Beach.Ongoing assessments determined Ian cost state and local agencies more than 25 million. If the White House grants the request, the declaration would provide direct financial aid to residents who incurred uninsured damages to their property in Charleston, Georgetown and Horry counties through the FEMA Individual Assistance Program, according to the news release. State and local government agencies and eligible non-profits in Berkeley, Charleston, Clarendon, Georgetown, Horry, Jasper and Williamsburg counties also would qualify for reimbursement of some storm-related costs through the Public Assistance Program. FEMA pays 75 of this aid. The division of the remaining 25 will be determined at a later date. The request, if approved, may also make disaster relief programs available through the Small Business Administration, along with FEMA Hazard Mitigation Program grants to help lessen the impact of future disasters, the release said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

A judge set his bond at 75,000 surety only with a GPS tether upon release, the Macomb County Prosecutor's Office said.It wasn't clear whether Freeman has an attorney who might comment on his behalf.The body of Gabriele Seitz of Shelby Township was discovered Thursday afternoon following a minor collision in which the driver of the truck fled the scene, Roseville police have said.\"When they opened the bed of the pickup truck they found a deceased person,\" Chief Ryan Monroe said at the time. \"We believe it was just a regular rear-end traffic crash. We don't believe at this time that the deceased has anything to do with the accident. We think the body was already in the back of the truck.\"A cause of death hasn't been determined. Freeman was arrested about 1 p.m. Saturday, jail records state. His probable cause hearing is scheduled for Nov. 9. A preliminary examination is set for Nov. 16.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jessie Alcheh)NEW YORK (AP) -- Kyrie Irving did not speak to reporters again Tuesday while the Brooklyn Nets decide how best to respond to the fallout from the star guard posting a link to an antisemitic film on social media.Irving defiantly defended himself and his right to post whatever he believes after the Nets' game Saturday, and general manager Sean Marks said the team didn't want to cause additional \"fuss\" by Irving speaking again after it played Tuesday.\"I think everybody knows he's going to have to answer these questions at some point and he hasn't sort of shied away in the past,\" Marks said. \"But I think the last postgame meeting didn't go well and we're not trying to cover it up, I think this is something that needs to be addressed, but let's address it in the right form and fashion.\"Irving was held to a season-low four points in the Nets' 108-99 loss to Chicago. He shot 2 for 12, missing all six 3-point attempts. Marks said the controversy surrounding Irving wasn't the catalyst for the team moving on from coach Steve Nash on Tuesday. But it's another headache for a team that is struggling on the court and alienating fans off it. Some wore \"Fight Antisemitism\" shirts while sitting courtside in the Nets' victory over Indiana on Monday.\"Look, it's understandable. I'm completely empathetic to what's going on here,\" Marks said. \"I'm certainly not proud of the situation we find ourselves in, you know?\"Irving, who deleted the Twitter post on Sunday, did not speak to the media after the game Monday.Marks said the organization is having discussions with the Anti-Defamation League for advice on the best course of action with Irving. Irving will continue playing in the meantime, but not speak for at least one more game.\"At some point he will come up here and do media again, but I think at this point we don't want to cause more fuss right now, more interaction with people,\" Marks said. \"Let's let him simmer down and let's ... I guess let's let cooler minds prevail. We need to go out and educate ourselves, educate the whole group and get some direction, seek from the experts, and one of them is certainly the ADL.\"AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Billie Jean King gets why No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek decided to skip the Billie Jean King Cup Finals because they are right after -- and half a world away from -- the WTA Finals. King just figures she would have made a different choice.\"I can totally understand her reasoning. I personally wouldn't agree with it. But you know what? It's about her. She's the one that's having to deal with reality now; I don't,\" King, the owner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles and a two-time inductee into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, said Tuesday during a video conference. \"We'll miss her.\"Swiatek, a 21-year-old from Poland with three major trophies, announced last month she would play in the WTA Finals happening now in Fort Worth, Texas, and skip the International Tennis Federation's 12-nation team competition named in honor of King that will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, from Nov. 8-13. Complaining that the \"situation is not safe for our health and could cause injury,\" she said she was disappointed the sport's governing bodies \"didn't come to an agreement on something as basic as the calendar of tournaments.\" WTA CEO Steve Simon acknowledged Tuesday that Swiatek is \"not wrong.\" \"This is a very tough schedule and a tough turnaround,\" Simon said. \"It's something that we're already talking about to see how we can fix that in the future.\" Swiatek leads women's tennis with eight titles and a 64-8 record in 2022. She played her opening round-robin match Tuesday at the WTA Finals.\"I would have liked her to wait a little longer (to decide about the BJK Cup Finals), because you never know how you're going to do. I mean, you just don't know. And this is where you have to figure out for yourself what's important to you,\" King said. \"For me, this would be a no-brainer.\" The WTA Finals were supposed to be held in Shenzhen, China, but were moved as part of the suspension of all tournaments in that country because of concerns about the safety of Peng Shuai, a Grand Slam doubles champion who accused a former Chinese government official of sexual assault, and COVID-19 restrictions there. The selection of Fort Worth as a substitute site for just this year was announced in September. Simon said he would have preferred that the WTA Finals end on an earlier date, but the Texas arena had a concert scheduled last week that prevented access to the venue before Friday for setup that included installation of a temporary court. Two members of the U.S. roster for the BJK Cup are at the WTA Finals, Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff.\"We definitely knew (it) was a tough turnaround. But I think for me, it's more of just a good problem to have. Of course, it's not ideal,\" Pegula said. \"Everyone makes their own kind of personal decision as far as (what is) physically healthy, mentally-wise what they need to do, but hopefully, it's just for this year.\" The other 10 countries in the BJK Cup Finals are Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czech Republic, Italy, Kazakhstan, Spain, Slovakia and Switzerland.AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Pietsch)Oregon's Bo Nix, left, throws down field ahead UCLA's Darius Muawai during the first half in an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 22, 2022, in Eugene, Ore. (AP Photo/Chris Pietsch)EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Bo Nix is fitting right in at Oregon with flashy plays and gaudy stats. The transfer from Auburn is even getting some Heisman buzz with 31 touchdowns so far this season -- 20 via pass and 11 more on the ground. He had six touchdowns this past weekend in No. 8 Oregon's 42-24 victory at California, the latest in a run of seven straight victories for the Ducks. Nix threw for 412 yards and three touchdowns, and ran for 59 yards and three more. On Monday, he was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. He's the only FBS quarterback who has had three games this season with three rushing touchdowns. His 11 rushing touchdowns are the most for Oregon since Marcus Mariota had 14 in 2014. Mariota finished with 38 passing touchdowns that year and won the Heisman. \"I don't think anyone can sit here and watch football right now and watch our quarterback play and not tell me he's an elite quarterback. This guy's playing at an extremely high level and he makes great decisions for our team. He's an elite competitor, an elite leader, he has phenomenal character, he's throwing the ball really well and making great decisions,\" Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. It didn't appear at first that this season would be a career year for Nix. The Ducks stumbled in their season opener to Georgia. But since then Oregon has been on a roll and is the only undefeated team in the Pac-12, averaging 48 points per game over their winning streak. Nix insists he's only as good as the players around him. \"I think it's just scheme, and the players around me. I think we've done such a good job of just reading the play that's called. When I'm out there when I'm doing it, if feels like I'm not doing a whole lot because I don't have to: I've just got to get the ball to the playmakers around me,\" he said after Oregon's victory over UCLA two weeks ago. Alabama's Bryce Young is vying to win a second consecutive Heisman Trophy. Other quarterbacks in contention include Tennessee's Hendon Hooker, Ohio State's C.J. Stroud and USC's Caleb Williams. Michigan running back Blake Corum is also in the mix. Stroud leads the nation with 29 passing touchdowns and a passing efficiency rating of 200.17. Williams has 24 passing touchdowns. Nix's rushing touchdowns lead the QB Heisman candidates. Nix's play harkens back to Mariota. He's dynamic and as flashy as Oregon's many uniforms. \"I'm one of those guys, when I'm evaluating quarterbacks, I'm always looking for somebody that can do more than just what the play is designed for -- and that's who Bo has been,\" said Colorado interim coach Mike Sanford.The Ducks (7-1, 5-0 Pac-12) visit the Buffaloes (1-7, 1-4) on Saturday. Nix, an Arkansas native and former five-star recruit, started the first 34 games of his career at Auburn. Last season, he threw for 2,294 yards with 11 touchdowns and three interceptions before hurting his ankle. He was held to 173 yards passing and no touchdowns in the Ducks' season-opener against Georgia, which intercepted him twice in a 49-3 rout. But since then he's adjusted well to first-year coach Lanning's system. Overall he's passed for 2,221 yards with five interceptions. He's completing 72.3 of his passes. And he's been helped by a sturdy offensive line that has allowed just one sack this season. Nix says the idea is to play aggressively while finding a balance and with protecting the ball. \"We're just playing good team football right now,\" he said. \"I think each and every one of us are very connected, very close to with one another, and that shows on the field.\"More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

(Sven Hoppe/dpa via AP)Tottenham and Eintracht Frankfurt both came from behind to win their respective games and secure a place in the last 16 of the Champions League.At halftime in the final round of group matches on Tuesday, Marseille and Sporting Lisbon were going through from Group D.But instead it was their opponents who progressed as a stoppage-time winner from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg saw Tottenham beat Marseille 2-1 to top the group and Frankfurt won by the same score in Lisbon to secure second spot on its Champions League debut.\"During the first half we didn't play well, it was difficult,\" Tottenham goalscorer Clement Lenglet said. \"When we go back in the dressing room it was an important moment for the game ... during the second half we played a better game, with a lot of intensity.\"The top two finishers in the other groups on Tuesday had already been decided, although not necessarily the order.Porto beat Atletico Madrid 2-1 to snatch top spot in Group B after Club Brugge was held to a 0-0 draw at Bayer Leverkusen.Napoli kept hold of first place in Group A despite dropping its first points in the Champions League this season in a 2-0 loss at second-place Liverpool.Bayern Munich did manage to progress with a perfect record as it beat Inter Milan 2-0 to make it six wins out of six. The four places in Group C had already been decided with Inter having secured second spot ahead of Barcelona. In a rare occurrence for a group, all four teams had entered the final round of games with a chance to advance.And which teams would go through and in what order changed several times over the night.But Hojbjerg scored with the last kick of the game at Stade Velodrome for a goal that lifted Tottenham to the top of Group D above Frankfurt, which was in first place until the Denmark midfielder's goal.That goal also meant Marseille finished in last place and will have no involvement in European competition in the new year.Lenglet had headed in the equalizer for Tottenham in the 54th minute after a woeful first half from the English side which didn't have a touch in the opposition penalty box before the break. Tottenham had fallen behind on the stroke of halftime when Chancel Mbemba headed in a corner.Frankfurt also came from behind, with Kolo Muani scoring a 72nd-minute winner for the visitors. Arthur Gomes had put the hosts ahead in the 39th and Frankfurt equalized with a penalty kick converted by Daichi Kamada in the 62nd.Atletico Madrid doesn't even have the consolation of the Europa League playoffs.The Spanish team was the heavy favorite to progress from its group but was left lamenting a last-place finish after losing at Porto, which secured top spot in Group B.Few expected Porto to even advance after losing its first two Champions League matches this season but the Portuguese team had already secured its place in the last 16 with a match to spare.And first-half goals from Mehdi Taremi and Stephen Eustaquio helped Porto win its fourth straight Champions League match to finish a point above Brugge.Brugge's Canadian winger Tajon Buchanan hit the crossbar in the opening seconds of the second half.It's back-to-back perfect group stage records for Bayern.Benjamin Pavard headed the German side in front in the first half and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting sealed the win against Inter in the 72nd minute with his seventh goal in his past six matches.Barcelona ended its disappointing Champions League campaign with a 4-2 win at Viktoria Plzen, which -- in contrast to Bayern -- fell to its sixth straight defeat.Ferran Torres scored twice and Marcos Alonso and teenager Pablo Torre grabbed a goal each for the Catalan club. The hosts got on the board with a pair of goals by Tomas Chory.Napoli was looking to become the first Italian team since AC Milan in 1992 to have six straight wins in its group.However, late goals from Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez ended the Italian side's unbeaten start to the season in all competitions.Liverpool finished level on points with Napoli but second on the head-to-head record after losing 4-1 in Italy in their Champions League opener.Rangers was left with an unwanted record after losing 3-1 at home to Ajax, which secured a place in the Europa League's qualifying playoffs.Rangers finished Group A with six straight losses and a goal difference of minus 20 -- the worst group stage record ever.AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

In a written plea agreement, Dhirendra Prasad described the schemes he carried out while he worked as a buyer for Apple's Global Service Supply chain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Prasad admitted the fraud involved \"taking kickbacks, inflating invoices, stealing parts, and causing Apple to pay for items and services never received,\" prosecutors said in a statement. For one scheme, prosecutors said Prasad arranged to have Apple components shipped to an outside vendor's warehouse, where they were repackaged and eventually sold back to Apple. \"Prasad admitted these schemes continued through 2018 and ultimately resulted in a loss to Apple of more than 17 million,\" the statement said.Prosecutors said Prasad, 52, entered guilty pleas on multiple counts including conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States. He could face more than 20 years in prison when he's sentenced next March. Two of his co-conspirators, outside vendors who did business with Apple, have been charged in separate federal cases.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams, File)NEW YORK (AP) -- Food writer Julie Powell, who became an internet darling after blogging for a year about making every recipe in Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\" leading to a book deal and a film adaptation, has died. She was 49.Powell died of cardiac arrest Oct. 26 at her home in upstate New York, The New York Times reported. Her death was confirmed by Judy Clain, Powell's email and editor in chief of Little, Brown.\"She was a brilliant writer and a daring, original person and she will not be forgotten,\" Clain said in a statement. \"We are sending our deepest condolences to all who knew and loved Julie, whether personally or through the deep connections she forged with readers of her memoirs.\"Powell's 2005 book \"Julie  Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen\" became the hit, Nora Ephron-directed film \"Julie  Julia,\" with the author portrayed in the movie by Amy Adams and Meryl Streep as Child.Her sophomore and last effort -- titled \"Cleaving: A Story of Marriage, Meat and Obsession\" -- was a bit jarring in its honesty. Powell revealed she had an affair, the pain of loving two men at once, of her fondness for sadomasochism and even a bout of self-punishing sex with a stranger.\"People coming from the movie 'Julie  Julia' and picking up 'Cleaving' are going to be in for some emotional whiplash,\" she told The Associated Press in 2009. \"I don't believe it's going to be a Nora Ephron movie.\"Powell began her affair in 2004 as she was putting the finishing touches on her first book, a time she writes when she was \"starry-eyed and vaguely discontented and had too much time on my hands.\"By 2006, she had landed an apprenticeship at a butcher shop two hours north of New York City, which offered an escape from her crumbling marriage and a place to explore her childhood curiosity with butchers.\"The way they held a knife in their hand was like an extension of themselves,\" she said. \"I'm a very clumsy person. I don't play sports. That kind of physical skill is really foreign to me, and I'm really envious of that.\"The book explores the link between butchering and her own tortured romantic life. At one point, while cutting the connective tissue on a pig's leg, she writes: \"It's sad, but a relief as well, to know that two things so closely bound together can separate with so little violence, leaving smooth surfaces instead of bloody shreds.\"Her book tapped into the growing interest in old school butchery and her experience slicing meat actually resulted in her eating less of it. She was an advocate for humanely raised and slaughtered animals.\"People want to get their hands dirty. People want to participate in the process. People want to know where their food is coming from,\" Powell said. \"People don't want the mystery anymore.\"She is survived by her husband, Eric.Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwitsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos)BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The presidents of Colombia and Venezuela met on Tuesday and said they would improve trade and security cooperation, as both countries seek to normalize relations following the election of Colombia's first leftist leader.After the meeting in Venezuela's presidential palace, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said it was \"suicidal\" for the governments of Venezuela and Colombia to have become estranged from each other recently, adding that the border between the countries had been forgotten and \"turned over\" to criminal mafias.Colombia's president said both countries would now look for ways to share intelligence on drug trafficking groups, and added that he would lobby for Venezuela's re-entry into the Andean Community of Nations, a regional trade and investment group that Venezuela withdrew from in 2006. Petro has asked for Venezuela's support in peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a Colombian rebel group that operates on both sides of the border.Petro's efforts to engage with Venezuela's socialist government mark a radical departure from Colombia's recent policy: Before Petro was elected in June, Colombia backed U.S. efforts to isolate Maduro's government, sanction its oil exports and force Maduro into holding free and fair elections.The United States, Colombia and dozens of other countries stopped recognizing Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader in 2019, after he won an election that was widely seen as undemocratic and backed a claim to Venezuela's presidency by the former National Assembly leader Juan Guaido.Petro changed course as soon as he was sworn into office and re-established diplomatic ties with the Maduro government. On Tuesday opposition leaders in Venezuela criticized Petro's meeting with Maduro, with Guaido tweeting that Petro was helping to \"normalize\" the violation of human rights in Venezuela by \"visiting dictator Maduro and calling him a president.\"The International Criminal Court is currently investigating Maduro's government for human rights violations that include the torture and arbitrary detention of protesters in 2017. In a recent letter addressed to Petro, Human Rights Watch pointed out that there are still more than 240 political prisoners in Venezuela and asked Petro to seek concrete human rights commitments from the Maduro administration as both nations re-establish diplomatic and military ties. The watchdog group added that military cooperation with Venezuela should be banned until Venezuela security forces stop backing drug traffickers and rebels. Evidence collected by Human Rights Watch and a U.N. Fact Finding Mission suggests that Venezuela's military conducted joint operations with the ELN last year to root out another rebel group and allowed them to take over gold mines in eastern Venezuela.Following the meeting Maduro said that he had listened to Petro's proposals and was also interested in developing a deal between both countries to produce fertilizer, which has become more expensive for many countries in Latin America, due to the war in Ukraine. \"It was an intense, fruitful and extensive meeting\" Maduro said.

All Rights Reserved.Everett DJ Hollywood plays music before Game 3 of baseball's World Series between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker Jr. waves during batting practice before Game 3 of baseball's World Series between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies are keeping the hits coming at this World Series.On the scoreboard -- and from Billboard.While Kyle Schwarber and the NL champion Phillies took batting practice ahead of Game 3 on Tuesday night, Mr Hollywood DJ and DJ Smooth stood behind a turntable near the home dugout, spinning tunes from a playlist created by backup catcher Garrett Stubbs.\"A lot of the guys have the music they like, and then I just ended up just putting it all together,\" Stubbs said. Clubhouse dance parties have been a staple celebration for the team during this October run, with Calum Scott's cover of \"Dancing on My Own\" the signature song. But the team has been pumping out jams before games, too, after players decided early in the season they wanted the right music to set the mood.\"They asked for it, so we said: 'That's any easy one,'\" president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski recalled.So they brought in Mr Hollywood DJ, otherwise known 39-year-old Everett Jackson, and DJ Smooth, a.k.a. 30-year-old Austin Sotoloff.Stubbs assembles the playlists, also used for those postgame bashes. Through early drills and batting practice, music pulses from the ballpark sound system. Players occasionally shimmied between swings Tuesday as they prepared to play the Houston Astros.\"They kind of wanted to pump it up a little bit more, bring the energy. The players love it. They have a good time,\" Mr Hollywood DJ said. Stubbs, a 29-year-old from San Diego, was acquired by the Phillies last November from the Astros. He greeted Houston general manager James Click and manager Dusty Baker with hugs when they walked by the batting cage.Stubbs' taste may be more traditional than most teammates: His walkup music is Frank Sinatra's version of Dean Kay and Kelly Gordon's \"That's Life.\"\"I like all music encompassing, so it's easy for me to put a lot of the songs they like on there,\" Stubbs said. \"I don't have very much knowledge in the rap genre. (Outfielder Brandon) Marsh is the guy to go to for rap music.\"Baker recalled Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" being picked for him as walkup music at Triple-A Richmond in 1970-71. Back then, players didn't have a choice.\"I would have probably had three or four of 'em depending on what mood I needed to be in,\" the 19-year big league outfielder said. \"From reggae music to Tupac (Skakur) or something like that to get me ready. I use that now to get me ready or to calm me down, whatever I need -- or to be angry or to be mellow. Music does that for me. First thing I do after I read, I turn my music on and my wife's like, Turn the music down. So I put the shirt on that says, If the music's too loud that means you're getting too old.'\"Scott's \"Dancing on My Own\" is reserved for playing in the ballpark and the clubhouse after wins. The artist hasn't performed it live at the park, but Stubbs hopes maybe he'll swing by if the Phillies win the Series. They entered Tuesday tied 1-1 with Houston.\"He won't be playing until we get that thing on our fingers,\" Stubbs said. \"People can look forward to something from him probably if we see it all the way through to the end.\"On-field DJs popped up at a few ballparks this season. At Yankee Stadium, slugger Giancarlo Stanton brought longtime friend and DJ ShaneO to mix things up.At the SkyDome in Toronto during the 1992 Series, the public address system played rock when the Jays practiced and elevator music -- classical and middle-of-the-road -- for Atlanta. The Braves returned musical favor with the reverse before Game 6 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.\"I would love to do that. I got Careless Whisper' on deck, just in case,\" Mr Hollywood DJ said, referencing a George Michael smooth jazz track. \"We got to get Houston in the mood.\"The pair packed up when the Phillies finished BP at 6 p.m. and moved to a booth in the second deck beyond first-base, where they spin in-game tunes.When the Astros practiced, they were met by \"Cold Heart,\" the Dua Lipa and Elton John remix, and Harry Styles' \"Music for a Sushi Restaurant.\"\"Mind games,\" Stubbs said.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/APCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)Coco Gauff returns a shot against Caroline Garcia of France during round robin play on day two of the WTA Finals tennis tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek performed so well against nearly every opponent all season that it should come as no surprise she's been perfect when facing the best of the best since early January.Swiatek extended her winning streak against opponents ranked in the top 10 to 13 matches -- the longest such single-season run in 15 years -- and opened her bid for a first WTA Finals title with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Daria Kasatkina in round-robin play Tuesday night.Swiatek has asserted herself as a dominant force in women's tennis, claiming two Grand Slam titles and eight tournament trophies in 2022. Her 65-8 match record leads the tour, too. That includes a 5-0 mark against Kasatkina this year.\"Sometimes, against players like that, there comes a little bit more doubt,\" said Swiatek, who will try to make it 14 in a row against top-10 foes when she takes on No. 6 Caroline Garcia, a 6-4, 6-3 winner over 18-year-old American Coco Gauff. \"But then it's a good thing to remember my strengths, and I'm kind of leaning on that and remembering that I learned a lot throughout this whole season,\" said Swiatek, who put together a 24-5 edge in winners against Kasatkina. \"I can use that experience and there's no reason why I would play worse than in practice.\"This one was pretty much over at the outset, when Swiatek raced to a 3-0 edge. She quickly adapted to the indoor hard court set up at Dickies Arena, and that start, she said, \"gave me confidence for the rest of the match.\"Said Kasatkina, who went 0 for 3 on break chances: \"The margin was too big\" at the beginning of each set.\"I knew it was going to be hard to balance being aggressive and not making a lot of mistakes, because she can reset the rallies,\" Swiatek said. \"I'm pretty happy that at the beginning, I was able to be proactive but, on the other hand, really solid.\"She is 13-1 against members of the top 10 this year, with the lone loss coming against then-No. 1 Ash Barty on Jan. 8. Barty's retirement at age 25 in March allowed Swiatek, a 21-year-old from Poland, to climb atop the rankings.No. 4 Gauff, the runner-up to Swiatek at the French Open in June, will now face No. 8 Kasatkina, who reached her first Grand Slam semifinal in Paris before losing to -- yes, you guessed it -- Swiatek.A year ago at the WTA Finals, Swiatek's debut in the season-closing tournament for the top eight women ended after the group stage. Garcia also has made it to this event just once before: She was eliminated in the semifinals in 2017.\"The past couple of years have been very rough,\" said Garcia, at 29 the oldest player in the field at Fort Worth. \"I'm really, really happy to be back. Five years is quite a long time in a career, but you try to manage as best you can.\"Garcia is also the only player at the WTA Finals who has defeated Swiatek this year, doing so in front of a partisan crowd at the Poland Open in July.\"It's definitely a good experience to take,\" Garcia said. \"To be aggressive is probably the best to try to beat her. When she has time to do her things, it's very complicated. She changes direction so well. She moves very well on court; with her sliding, she looks like she covers two courts.\"Swiatek has earned the same number of titles this season as the other seven women combined.That doesn't mean she is only thinking about collecting hardware.She often practices visualization before heading out on court, although she said she did not do that Tuesday ahead of facing Kasatkina.\"I'm not the kind of person who's going to visualize myself with trophies. I don't think it's going to lead anywhere,\" Swiatek said. \"So usually, it's (about) technique and perfect preparation for the shot.\"She was grateful for the fans waving the Polish flag or wearing the country's red and white colors, but she also noticed the thousands of empty seats in the venue, saying in her on-court interview: \"Hopefully we're going to see a full house soon.\"AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.South Korean and U.S. air forces have began combined air drills amid growing concerns that North Korea may conduct a nuclear test after North Korea fired three short range ballistic missiles toward the East Sea on Wednesday. (Nov. 2)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded on a South Korean island and residents evacuated to underground shelters after North Korea fired more than 20 missiles Wednesday, at least one of them in its direction and landing near the rivals' tense sea border. South Korea quickly responded by launching its own missiles in the same border area.The launches came hours after North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons to get the U.S. and South Korea to \"pay the most horrible price in history\" in protest of ongoing South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. The White House maintained that the United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea and vowed to work with allies to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.The North's barrage of missile tests also came as world attention was focused on South Korea following a weekend Halloween tragedy that saw more than 150 people killed in a crowd surge in Seoul in what was the country's largest disaster in years.South Korea's military said North Korea launched at least 23 missiles -- 17 in the morning and six in the afternoon -- off its its eastern and western coasts on Wednesday. It said the weapons were all short-range ballistic missiles or suspected surface-to-air missiles. Also Wednesday, North Korea fired about 100 artillery shells into an eastern maritime buffer zone the Koreas created in 2018 to reduce tensions, according to South Korea's military.The 23 missiles launched is a record number of daily missile tests by North Korea, some experts say.One of the ballistic missiles was flying toward South Korea's Ulleung island before it eventually landed 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of the island. South Korea's military issued an air raid alert on the island, according to the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff. South Korean media published photos of island residents moving to underground shelters.Hours later, South Korea's military said it lifted the air raid alert on the island. South Korea's transport ministry said it has closed some air routes above the country's eastern waters until Thursday morning in the wake of the North Korean launches. That missile landed 26 kilometers (16 miles) away from the rivals' sea border. It landed in international waters off the east coast of South Korea. South Korea's military said it was the first time a North Korean missile has landed so close to the sea border since the countries' division in 1948.\"This is very unprecedented and we will never tolerate it,\" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.In 2010, North Korea shelled a front-line South Korean island off the peninsula's western coast, killing four people. But the weapons used were artillery rockets, not ballistic missiles whose launches or tests are banned by multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.Later Wednesday, South Korean fighter jets launched three air-to-surface, precision-guided missiles near the eastern sea border to show its determination to get tough on North Korean provocations. South Korea's military said the missiles landed in international waters at the same distance of 26 kilometers (16 miles) north of the sea border as the North Korean missile fell earlier Wednesday.It said it maintains a readiness to win \"an overwhelming victory\" against North Korea in potential clashes. \"North Korea firing missiles in a way that sets off air raid sirens appears intended to threaten South Koreans to pressure their government to change policy,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"North Korea's expanding military capabilities and tests are worrisome, but offering concessions about alliance cooperation or nuclear recognition would make matters worse.\"The Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier identified three of the North Korean weapons launched as \"short-range ballistic missiles\" fired from the North's eastern coastal town of Wonsan, including the one that landed near the sea border. North Korean short-range weapons are designed to strike key facilities in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there. In an emergency meeting with top security officials, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered officials to take swift unspecified steps to make North Korea face consequences for its provocation. He said he would consider the North Korean missile's landing near the border \"a virtual violation of (our) territorial waters.\"During the meeting, officials also lamented that the North Korean missile launches came as South Korea is in a mourning period over the crowd crush. They noted this \"clearly showed the nature of the North Korean government,\" according to South Korea's presidential office. Earlier Wednesday, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said at least two ballistic missiles fired by North Korea showed a possibly \"irregular\" trajectory. This suggests the missiles were the North's highly maneuverable, nuclear-capable KN-23 missile, which was modeled on Russia's Iskander missile.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called North Korea's continuing missile tests \"absolutely impermissible.\"Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea said the danger of armed clashes between the Koreas off their western or eastern coasts is increasing. He said South Korea needs to make \"proportional responses\" to North Korean provocations, not \"overwhelming responses,\" to prevent tensions from spiraling out of control and possibly leading the North to use its tactical nuclear weapons. Animosities on the Korean Peninsula have been running high in recent months, with North Korea testing a string of nuclear-capable missiles and adopting a law authorizing the preemptive use of its nuclear weapons in a broad range of situations. Some experts still doubt North Korea would use nuclear weapons first in the face of U.S. and South Korean forces.North Korea has argued its recent weapons tests were meant to issue a warning to Washington and Seoul over their joint military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal, including this week's exercises. In a statement released early Wednesday, Pak Jong Chon, a secretary of the ruling Workers' Party who is considered a close confidant of leader Kim Jong Un, called the Vigilant Storm air force drills \"aggressive and provocative.\"\"If the U.S. and South Korea attempt to use armed forces against (North Korea) without any fear, the special means of the (North's) armed forces will carry out their strategic mission without delay,\" Pak said, in an apparent reference to his country's nuclear weapons. \"The U.S. and South Korea will have to face a terrible case and pay the most horrible price in history,\" he said.U.S. and South Korean officials have steadfastly said their drills are defensive in nature and that they have no intentions of attacking North Korea.\"We reject the notion that they serve as any sort of provocation. We have made clear that we have no hostile intent towards (North Korea) and call on them to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy,\" White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said late Tuesday.North Korea \"continues to not respond. At the same time, we will continue to work closely with our allies and partners to limit the North's ability to advance its unlawful weapons programs and threaten regional stability,\" Watson said.This year's Vigilant Storm military exercises are the largest-ever for the annual fall maneuvers, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said. About 1,600 flights are planned involving 240 U.S. and South Korean fighter jets. The round-the-clock drills, which began Oct. 31, are to continue through Nov. 4 and include warfighting tactics both in the air and on the ground, it said.Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Aamer Madhani in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Acacia Coronado)AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Families of some of the 19 children killed in the Uvalde school massacre commemorated the Day of Dead with a rally, procession and a decorated altar outside the Texas Capitol on Tuesday night. Relatives, who marched to the mansion of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott carrying the altar, chose the location to again demand tougher gun laws in Texas following the May shooting at Robb Elementary School. They have been most vocal about raising the age to purchase AR-15-style rifles from 18 to 21. Abbott, who is up for reelection, has pushed back on that, saying it would be \"unconstitutional.\"\"We are here today celebrating our children's lives,\" said Kimberly Rubio, whose daughter Lexi Rubio died in the Uvalde shooting, \"but also trying to reach out to parents on a personal, on a mom and dad level. Just if you care about your children, protect them, go out to vote for candidates who support sensible gun legislation.\" Day of the Dead -- or Dia de los Muertos -- is a Mexican and Latino holiday in which people celebrate the lives of deceased loved ones and encourage their souls to visit with them. Nearly three-quarters of the residents of Uvalde are Hispanic. Abbott is running for a third term against Democrat Beto O'Rourke, who has drawn the support of several Robb Elementary parents but faces an uphill climb in Tuesday's election.

All Rights Reserved.Israeli far-right lawmaker and the head of \"Jewish Power\" party, Itamar Ben-Gvir, gestures after first exit poll results for the Israeli Parliamentary election at his party's headquarters in Jerusalem, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Oren Ziv)Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Prime Minister and the head of Likud party celebrates the first exit poll results for Israel's election, at the Likud party headquarters in Jerusalem, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov)For the fifth time in four years, Israelis went to the polls, and once again, no clear victor immediately emerged.Exit polls by Israeli media gave former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his nationalist and religious allies a slight edge early Wednesday, but the final tally could change as the official count is conducted.Already, there was talk that a small Arab nationalist party could play spoiler, leaving Netanyahu and his opponents evenly split in Israel's Knesset, or parliament, and putting the country on track for yet another election early next year.Meanwhile, a Jewish ultranationalist faction was projected to become the third-largest party in the Knesset. It would gain unprecedented clout in a Netanyahu-led government -- but only if one can be formed.Here's a look at where the election results stand.Official results won't be published until later this week, but exit polls carried out by Israel's three main TV channels projected that Netanyahu and his allies will win 61 to 62 seats in the 120-member Knesset, just enough to form a government.His opponents, an array of parties from across the political spectrum currently led by caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, a political centrist, were projected to win 54 seats.A small Arab nationalist party, Balad, was reportedly close to the electoral threshold of 3.25 of the vote. If it passes that threshold, it would gain four seats and erase Netanyahu's edge. If it falls short, those votes would be wasted, strengthening Netanyahu's camp.No political party has ever won an outright majority in Israel, so larger parties like Netanyahu's Likud must assemble majority coalitions with smaller ones, which can involve weeks of negotiations. That process can only really begin once the official results are in.This election, like the previous four going back to 2019, was largely centered on Netanyahu, who is on trial for serious corruption charges and remains a deeply polarizing figure.Netanyahu was Israel's longest-serving prime minister, holding the office for 12 straight years -- after an initial three-year run in the 1990s -- before being ousted by a broad but fragile coalition last year.His supporters view him as a champion of Israel's nationalist right and a master statesman who is the victim of a witch hunt by political opponents in Israel's judiciary, law enforcement and media.Netanyahu's critics view him as a crook who threatens Israel's democratic institutions by placing his legal woes above the national interest.With the focus on Netanyahu, Israel's decades-long conflict with the Palestinians has been left on the back burner in recent elections, even as violence has steadily risen and hard-liners on both sides have gained popularity.The only clear winner from the elections so far is Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician who has moved from Israel's ultranationalist fringe to the mainstream as the country has drifted rightwards over the past two decades.His Religious Zionism faction, formally led by another far-right figure, Bezalal Smotrich, is projected to win 14 to 15 seats and emerge as the third-largest party in the Knesset. If Netanyahu forms a government, Ben-Gvir is expected to request a Cabinet post as the minister in charge of police.Ben-Gvir is a disciple of Rabbi Meir Kahane, an anti-Arab racist who called for the mass deportation of Palestinians and stripping Arabs of Israeli citizenship. His Kach party was banned in Israel and outlawed as a terrorist organization in the United States, and Kahane was shot dead in 1990.Ben-Gvir, who was convicted of incitement and supporting terrorism years ago and has represented Jewish extremists facing similar charges, has been careful to publicly distance himself from Kahane's most extreme beliefs.But he has still called for the deportation of Arab lawmakers, the death sentence for convicted terrorists and greater immunity for Israeli security forces battling Palestinian militants.Ben-Gvir also makes frequent, provocative appearances in areas where Israeli-Palestinian tensions are running high, often exacerbating them before TV cameras. Last month he brandished a handgun in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood while shouting at police to fire on Palestinian stone-throwers.If the exit polls hold and Netanyahu is able to form a government with his natural allies, it would be the most extreme right-wing coalition in Israel's history.Any peace negotiations with the Palestinians, which collapsed shortly after Netanyahu last ascended to the premiership in 2009, would be virtually unthinkable. That could heighten tensions with the Biden administration, which supports a two-state solution, as well as Israel's allies in the U.S., particularly the more liberal Jewish-American community.A Netanyahu-led government could enact reforms that would make his legal woes disappear, something that critics say would undermine Israel's democracy and the rule of law.Netanyahu's supporters have sought to tamp down such worries, saying any changes to the legal code would not apply in his case and that he can rein in more extreme coalition partners like Ben-Gvir. But that could prove difficult if -- as the polls project -- Religious Zionism accounts for a quarter of the coalition's seats in parliament.If Netanyahu fails to form a government, the country will most likely head to elections again in March, potentially giving him yet another shot at returning to power.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

They then posed for a picture, with both flashing their middle fingers.\"Let's do a thumbs-up,\" she suggested, and they flipped they script to take that picture.On Tuesday night, hours after the video clip made the rounds, Verlander tweeted that he meant no harm.\"Whole interaction was in jest as all the fans around you were just saying hello in their native tongue,\" Verlander posted on Twitter. \"So I responded in kind ... all in good fun. I enjoyed the banter.\"Verlander is 0-6 with a 6.07 ERA in eight World Series starts.He got a no-decision in Game 1 against the Phillies when he couldn't hold an early 5-0 lead.Verlander is expected to start Game 5 at Philadelphia.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Canada has unveiled plans for a big increase in the number of immigrants entering the country, with a goal of seeing 500,000 people arrive each year by 2025 as it seeks to address a critical labor shortage. Immigration Minister Sean Fraser revealed the new plan on Tuesday. It puts a heavy emphasis on admitting more permanent residents with needed work skills and experience, alongside more-modest targets for family members and refugees. The opposition Conservative party welcomed the plan. \"Make no mistake. This is a massive increase in economic migration to Canada,\" Fraser said. \"We have not seen such a focus on economic migration as we've seen in this immigration levels plan.\"The new plan envisions a flood of new arrivals that will see 465,000 people come in from outside the country in 2023, rising to 500,000 in 2025. By comparison, the immigration department says 405,000 permanent residents were admitted last year.Most of those new arrivals will be what are known as economic immigrants, who will be expected to fill some of the roughly 1 million jobs that are currently sitting empty across various sectors of the economy.\"There were a million jobs available in the Canadian economy at a time when immigration already accounts for nearly all of our labor force growth,\" Fraser said. \"We cannot maximize our economic potential if we don't embrace immigration.\"While the influx could put even more pressure on already scarce affordable housing in many parts of the country, Fraser suggested the new workers could actually enable the construction of more homes by addressing a shortage of tradespeople.While most of the planned growth in immigration over the next three years will be focused on bolstering the economy, the new plan also calls for a small increase in the number of family members who will be admitted into Canada. It also projects an overall decrease in the number of refugees, from a high of 76,000 in 2023 to fewer than 73,000 in 2025, which Fraser attributed to the government's plan to finish resettling 40,000 Afghan refugees next year.\"In each of the last two years, we have resettled more than one-third of the total number of refugees who were settled globally,\" he added. \"And each of the last three years, we have resettled more refugees than any other country in the world.\"Despite the decrease, a representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees welcomed the government's continued support for accepting asylum seekers fleeing war and other threats.\"The United Nations Refugee Agency welcomes Canada's continued commitment to refugee resettlement as part of its overall immigration growth plan,\" UNHCR Representative in Canada Rema Jamous Imseis said in a statement.The response from Canadian industry was more mixed, with the Business Council of Canada arguing the government's plan didn't go far enough in addressing the country's unprecedented labor shortage.Opposition Conservative immigration critic Tom Kmiec also welcomed the plan to dramatically increase the number of new arrivals in Canada, but questioned whether the government would actually be able to meet its own targets.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A California judge is allowing a lawsuit to proceed against the Los Angeles Angels over the drug-related death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs.Orange County Superior Court Judge Glenn Salter on Monday rejected the team's motion to dismiss and set the start of a 20-day jury trial for Oct. 2, 2023.Skaggs, 27, was found dead on July 1, 2019, in a hotel room in the Dallas suburb of Southlake on the same day that the Angels were supposed to open a four-game road trip against the Texas Rangers. A coroner's report said Skaggs choked to death on his vomit and that a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was in his system.Last month, Eric Kay, a former Angels public relations employee, was sentenced in Texas to 22 years in federal prison after being convicted of conspiracy and distributing the drugs that led to Skaggs' death.The trial included testimony from five major league players who said they received oxycodone pills from Kay at various times from 2017-19, the years he was accused of obtaining pills and giving them to players at Angel Stadium. Skaggs' widow, Carli Skaggs, sued the Angels for wrongful death and negligent hiring and supervision, alleging that team officials knew Kay was distributing drugs to players but promoted him and allowed him continued access to them.The Angels have denied the accusation, but the judge rejected a request from the team to dismiss the suit, saying, \"There are enough factual allegations\" to proceed to trial.Two lawsuits were filed, one in Texas on behalf of Skaggs' parents and one in California for his widow. The Angels this year agreed to allow the parents to join the California suit, and the Texas case is expected to be withdrawn.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Republican Liz Cheney visited Michigan to support Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in her race for re-election (Nov. 2)(AP video: Mike Householder)EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Republican Rep. Liz Cheney visited Michigan on Tuesday to support Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who the the Wyoming representative crossed party lines to endorse last week in a first. \"If we want to ensure the survival of our republic, we have to walk away from politics as usual,\" Cheney said. \"We have to stand up, every one of us, and say we're going to do what's right for this country. We're going to look beyond partisan politics.\"Slotkin is a two-term House member competing against Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett in Michigan's redrawn 7th Congressional District, which includes Lansing. The contest is among the most expensive House races in the country and is considered a toss-up.Slotkin, who described herself as a Democrat representing a Trump-voting district, told reporters that Cheney approached her last month on the House floor about the possible endorsement. Slotkin acknowledged during her speech that the two differ on most policy issues, joking that the last time Cheney was in the area was to counter something the Lansing-area Democrat was doing.\"But there is one really, really big thing we agree on and that is preserving the American democracy,\" Slotkin said. Cheney's visit to the battleground state comes as she considers a 2024 presidential run after losing her primary earlier this year. Cheney was one of eight House Republicans who lost primaries or chose not to seek reelection after voting to impeach former President Donald Trump in 2020. In her endorsement last week, Cheney mentioned that she's become acquainted with Slotkin while serving together on the House Armed Services Committee. Slotkin also worked in U.S. intelligence, national security and defense during the Obama and Bush administrations.Cheney said that this was the first time she has ever campaigned for a Democrat but that \"it was not a hard decision at all.\"Both have been vocal critics of House Republicans who have sought to downplay the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cheney is vice chair of the House Jan. 6 committee, which recently issued a subpoena for Trump to testify. \"As a nation today, we are facing an ongoing assault by the former president and by people that are spreading his lie,\" Cheney said Tuesday. Following Cheney's endorsement last week, her primary opponent Harriet Hageman and former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard both announced that they were supporting Barrett in the Lansing-area race.Barrett criticized Cheney during an event Tuesday morning for having the \"audacity\" to endorse his opponent in a critical race that will \"decide which party controls Congress.\"\"Elissa Slotkin and Liz Cheney prove that the political establishment has an unquenchable thirst for military engagement abroad,\" Barrett said during the Howell event.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- More than 400 people died in October in a series of crowd-related disasters in Asia, when a bridge packed with revelers collapsed in India, Halloween partiers were crushed in South Korea's capital, and spectators fled a stadium in Indonesia after police fired tear gas.The dynamics in the three situations were distinct, though experts say poor planning and crowd management contributed to the disasters in Indonesia and South Korea. In India, authorities are investigating whether the recently repaired bridge was properly inspected.In Seoul, 156 people died when more than 100,000 flocked to the popular nightlife district of Itaewon on Saturday for Halloween celebrations, the first since the country's strict COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. The narrow, sloping alleys of the district became clogged with people, leading to what experts call \"crowd turbulence.\" That's when people are so packed together that they don't have full control over their movements, and the crowd moves as a continuous body. \"It doesn't require anybody to misbehave, doesn't require anybody to aggressively or intentionally push,\" said Milad Haghani, a researcher at Australia's University of New South Wales, Sydney.It is well documented that when crowd densities reach the levels estimated at the Itaewon celebration, people will fall, triggering a domino effect, said Haghani, who has studied more than 275 such crowd-related tragedies dating back to 1902.But it's also preventable, he said.Seoul authorities have been criticized for having 137 officers on hand Saturday to deal with such a large crowd. Officials regularly dispatch many more police to control protests in the capital. Yoon Hee Keun, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, told a televised news conference Tuesday that he felt a \"heavy responsibility\" for the loss of life.By looking at past celebrations, and factoring in the end of COVID-19 restrictions, authorities could have easily anticipated large crowds, Haghani said.More important than additional police, South Korean authorities could have employed crowd-control experts to monitor the flow of people and prevented the area from getting as packed as it did, he said. Lessons from well-studied tragedies like Germany's 2010 Love Parade disaster, where 21 people died trying to exit an area through a bottleneck, make crowd turbulence situations predictable when experts are watching, he said.\"It is really disappointing to see that despite all of the expert experience, all of the studies, all of the conclusions and everything that was done, it happened again in another country, in another location, and it actually resulted in many more people dying,\" said Haghani.Indonesia is still investigating the Oct. 1 tragedy at a soccer stadium, in which 135 people died, including dozens of children. Police fired tear gas into the stadium, where some gates were locked, after some the crowd of 42,000 spilled onto the field, sending them rushing toward the exits and causing a crush. Soehatman Ramli, chairman of Indonesia's World Safety Organization, told The Associated Press that the case showed what can occur without a proper risk management plan and courses of action in case of emergency.\"These plans should include evacuation routes and crowd management for controlling panic situations,\" Ramli said.Already, police have said that Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang city did not have a proper operating certificate and that criminal charges would be brought against six people for negligence, including the three police officers who allowed or ordered officers to use tear gas.Authorities have removed the police chiefs of East Java province and Malang district and suspended other officers over violations of professional ethics.A fact-finding team set up by President Joko Widodo found that the tear gas was the main cause of the tragedy -- a conclusion Haghani said was not surprising.\"Experience has shown that tear gas in a sports stadium is a recipe for disaster, in that it agitates the crowds, it creates a fight-back tendency in the crowd, and more aggressive behavior,\" he said.After the weekend collapse of a newly repaired suspension bridge in India's Gujarat state in which 134 people died, authorities have announced the arrest of nine people, including managers of the bridge's operator. The 143-year-old bridge reopened four days before Sunday's collapse under the weight of hundreds of people who were celebrating during the Hindu festival season.A security video of the disaster showed it shaking violently and people trying to hold on to its cables and metal fencing before the aluminum walkway gave out and crashed into the river.The bridge split in the middle with its walkway hanging down and its cables snapped.Investigations are still underway, but a local official told the Indian Express newspaper that the company reopened the bridge without first obtaining a \"fitness certificate.\"All three October disasters serve as reminders of the variety of ways in which authorities are responsible for ensuring public safety, said Dirk Helbing, a professor of computational social science at the ETH Zurich university who studies crowd dynamics.\"In the past decades, science has provided many new insights and tools to contribute to crowd safety and management,\" he said. \"I hope this knowledge will spread quickly and thereby help to avoid disasters in the future.\" Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this story.

Lakewood Police Department spokesperson Lt. Chris Lawler told The News Tribune Tuesday that Lakewood officers were called to Western State Hospital at about 7:15 p.m. Friday after fire crews responded for a report of an unresponsive patient. Lawler said fire crews requested police after noticing the death looked suspicious. \"We responded and noticed the victim patient had a lot of trauma, indicating not a natural or expected death,\" Lawler said.The victim's 51-year-old roommate was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder.The victim has not been publicly identified. Tyler Hemstreet, a spokesperson for the state Department of Social and Health Services, said the victim had been a patient at the hospital since 1989. He said the man had been found not guilty by reason of insanity on a first-degree murder charge. The victim's roommate had been at the hospital since 2014 on a first-degree assault charge.Both men were housed in a wing of the hospital reserved for patients found not guilty of a criminal charge by reason of insanity, Hemstreet said. He said the hospital has about 120 patients there under the same circumstances. \"We're offering support to our staff and other patients throughout the hospital who have been affected by this sad and tragic incident,\" Hemstreet said. \"Our thoughts are with the victim and his family during this difficult time.\"The death occurred during a 15-minute window between hospital staff rounds, Hemstreet said.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Alec Bohm hit the 1,000th home run in World Series history Tuesday night, and the Philadelphia Phillies quickly went to work on launching the next thousand.Bryce Harper, Bohm and Brandon Marsh teed off early against Houston starter Lance McCullers Jr. in Game 3 of the 118th World Series. Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins hit back-to-back drives to finish McCullers in the fifth inning, capping the scoring in a 7-0 victory that gave Philadelphia a 2-1 Series lead.The five home runs tied a World Series record done three previous times -- by the 1928 Murderers' Row New York Yankees when Babe Ruth hit three and Lou Gehrig also connected, by the Bash Brothers-led 1989 Oakland A's in the first game after the Bay Area earthquake, and by the sign stealing scandal-tainted Astros in 2017.McCullers became the first pitcher in postseason history to get tagged for five home runs in a game.Harper began the barrage with a two-run drive in the first inning, sending Citizens Bank Park into a frenzy.Bohm led off with a liner over the left-field wall in the second for the milestone homer. Two batters later, Marsh hit home run No. 1,001, a high fly that a young fan in the front row of the right-field seats dropped back onto the field.\"I feel awesome about it. I was just really excited that the ball was coming toward me so I just got out of my seat and tried to catch it,\" said 10-year-old Ty Kuhner from Wilmington, Delaware, who was at the game with his parents and older sister, Madison.Schwarber, who led the National League with 46 home runs this year, hit his fourth homer of the postseason, a two-run Schwarbomb into the center-field shrubbery. Hoskins followed with a drive to left that chased McCullers. Cy Young himself gave up the first World Series homer, an inside-the-parker to Pittsburgh's Jimmy Sebring against Boston in the first World Series game in 1903.Mickey Mantle holds the record for most World Series home runs with 18.

All Rights Reserved.Jackson State head coach Deion Sanders glares at his players as they exit the field during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Southern University in Jackson, Miss., Saturday, Oct. 29, 2022. Jackson State won 35-0. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Jackson State coach Deion Sanders has forbidden his players from leaving the team hotel while they're in Houston for Saturday's game against Texas Southern after the rapper Takeoff was fatally shot in the city early Tuesday.Houston police said the 28-year-old member of Grammy-nominated trio Migos was killed around 2:30 a.m. An argument had broken out among a group of 40 people who were leaving a party at a downtown bowling alley, police said.In a YouTube video of a team meeting, Sanders told his unbeaten squad that family and friends must visit at JSU's hotel this weekend. Going forward, the Hall of Fame cornerback added that means players can't associate with some of the same friends and women they used to.\"You're not whoever you were a year ago, you're not even who you're going to be a year from now, which is a blessing,\" Sanders said. \"But you can't continuously do the things you've always done and expect to get the results. There's gonna have to be a change.\"The coach acknowledged Takeoff's death in a dice game and asked his team to pray for the families.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Nikita Kucherov had a goal and two assists, and the Tampa Bay Lightning rallied to beat the Ottawa Senators 4-3 on Tuesday night.Tampa Bay went ahead to stay when Kucherov scored from the low right circle with 2:30 remaining off a cross-ice pass by Mikhail Sergachev. Kucherov has a four-game goal streak and an eight-game point streak overall.Tampa Bay scored three of the four goals between the teams over the final 8:56 of the game.\"It was a wild one, no doubt about it,\" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.Ottawa's Brady Tkachuk had his shot during a breakaway with 1 second to play go just wide. The chance came after Tampa Bay failed to score on an empty-net rush.\"Shows don't leave the game until its over,\" Cooper said.Sergachev, Alex Killorn and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 12 saves. The Lightning went 1 for 8 on the power play.\"It was just a weird one ... thankfully it didn't hurt us,\" Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said.Tampa Bay played without star defenseman Victor Hedman, who is considered day to day after he was scratched an upper-body injury.Ottawa's Anton Forsberg stopped 30 shots. Dylan Gambrell, Mathieu Joseph and Claude Giroux scored for the Senators.\"I don't know if we should have won this game, that's a good team and they don't panic out there,\" Joseph said. \"I think we were just a little bit immature in the way we finished the game here.\"Point tied it at 3 with 7:05 to play in the third.After Killorn scored at 11:04 of the third, Ottawa regained the lead at 3-2. Tkachuk stole the puck from Vasilevskiy behind the net and set up Giroux in the slot.Forsberg made a strong post-to-post save during the opening minute of the second on Stamkos, who raised his stick after taking his left circle power-play shot thinking it would end up in the net.Joseph, playing his first game against his old team after being traded in March, put the Senators up 2-1 on a breakaway with 7:39 left in the second. Joseph got his first goal of the season with Tampa Bay on a 5-on-3 power play.The Lightning's two-man advantage was part of a five-minute penalty for a hit on Erik Cernak by Gambrell at 7:27. Cernak went to the locker room but returned later in the period.Tampa Bay had six shots, and Stamkos hit the post, during the extended power play as the Lightning outshot Ottawa 26-8 through two periods. \"Strange game,\" Point said. \"Execution wasn't there for a lot of it. I thought our 5-on-5 was actually not too bad. The power plays in the second, we got so many and did nothing with them, It's tough.\"Stamkos had seven shots in the opening 40 minutes. He finished with eight shots and two assists. He has gone five games without a goal after getting seven in the first five of the season.Sergachev tied it at 1 on the power play at 3:17 of the second.Gambrell, playing in his first game of the season, made it 1-0 on the Senators' first shot 5:44 into the game. Vasilevskiy stopped Drake Batherson's shot during a 2-on-none during a second-period power play. Senators: G Cam Talbot (ribs) went through an extensive on-ice session after the morning skate and is expected to return within a week. \"We're hopeful that over the next two, three games that he can get back,\" Ottawa coach D.J. Smith said.Senators: Start a three-game homestand Thursday night against Vegas.Lightning: Host Carolina on Thursday night.AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles County will pay 47.6 million to settle lawsuits alleging misconduct by sheriff's deputies, including 8 million to the family of a man whose killing prompted large protests two years ago. The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to approve payouts to resolve five cases, the Los Angeles Times reported.In three of the cases deputies shot people; in one, deputies failed to prevent a man from killing himself in jail and in another a man -- whose family said he was suffering a mental health crisis -- died after being violently restrained by deputies. The board approved each settlement unanimously, the Times said. The county will pay 8 million to the family of 18-year-old Andres Guardado, who was shot five times in the back by a deputy in 2020.Sheriff's officials have said Guardado displayed a handgun when two deputies spotted him outside an auto body shop where his family said he worked as a security guard.Guardado had surrendered, placed the handgun on the ground and was lying face down when one of the deputies, Miguel Vega, approached to cinch handcuffs around the teenager's wrists, Vega's attorney previously told the Times.According to the deputy's account, Guardado reached for the gun, prompting Vega to fire six shots, five of which hit Guardado.His father, Cristobal Guardado, said in a statement that while the settlement brings closure, the family won't have peace until the deputy is held criminally responsible. In another case, 16.2 million was approved for the family of Eric Briceno, 39, who died in 2020 after being beaten and shot with a stun gun at his family's Maywood home.His mother had called the Sheriff's Department to say her son was having a mental health crisis and seeking help. The coroner's office said Briceno died from the effects of being restrained.The district attorney's office is still deciding whether to file charges against the deputies in the deaths of Guardado and Briceno, a spokesperson said Tuesday.The largest settlement -- 16.5 million -- was awarded to Timothy Neal, who was shot by deputies in 2019 after they breached the door of his bedroom, where he was holding two knives, according to the DA's office review of the incident.Prosecutors declined to file charges against the deputies, concluding that they acted in self-defense.Deputies had also gone to the house a day earlier after Neal's mother called the Sheriff's Department to say he was psychotic and trying to kill her. Deputies left after an hours-long standoff but returned the next day after Neal's mother placed a second call.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jessie Alcheh)NEW YORK (AP) -- Zach LaVine scored 20 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, leading the Chicago Bulls to a 108-99 victory over Brooklyn on Tuesday night in the Nets' first game after a coaching change.The Nets announced Steve Nash was out earlier in the day, then fell to 2-6 with Jacque Vaughn leading them.Kevin Durant had 32 points and nine rebounds for the Nets, but Kyrie Irving managed only four points on 2-for-12 shooting. He missed all six 3-point attempts.Vaughn stopped short of equating Irving's struggles to the criticism he's been dealing with since posting a link to a film with antisemitic content on his Twitter account last week.\"The message I told the guys after, no excuses,\" Vaughn said. \"Whether it's back-to-backs, no excuses. Whether the change in scenery today, no excuses. This is what we do for a living. We signed up for it.\"Durant found out on television that Nash was removed after waking up from an afternoon nap. He said he was not approached by upper management about the decision.\"It was a roller coaster last few years, but the core of the basketball is something we all love to do,\" Durant said. \"Regardless of who is the coach, regardless the circumstances, you still got to come to work, and I enjoyed coming to work with Steve.\"DeMar DeRozan added 20 points and Ayo Dosunmu had 17 for the Bulls, who outscored the Nets 31-19 in the final quarter. Goran Dragic, who played last season with the Nets, chipped in 15 off the bench as the Bulls snapped a two-game losing streak.Royce O'Neale matched his career high with 20 points and Nic Claxton had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who played without Ben Simmons for a second straight night because of a sore left knee.LaVine had nine points on 4-for-11 shooting from the field before he outscored the Nets in the final 12 minutes of the game, going 6 for 10 from the field.\"The thing that I thought was good for him is that he is finding his rhythm,\" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. \"The one thing I give him a lot of credit for tonight, he made really quick, decisive decisions. It was catch and shoot. He didn't hesitate, when they were there, he took them.\"The Bulls trailed 80-77 at the start of the fourth quarter before the All-Star guard heated up. The Nets still led 88-84 before Dosunmu sparked a 7-0 run with a 3-pointer opposite the Bulls bench to take a 91-88 lead.Irving answered with a layup but LaVine responded with three straight baskets, including a 3-pointer that made it 99-90 with 5:37 left in regulation and put the game out of reach.\"We are all aggressive and sometimes you catch a rhythm,\" said LaVine, who is managing his left knee after undergoing offseason surgery. \"That's all I am looking to do. It's my fifth game back and catch a rhythm. I am feeling better each game.\"Durant scored 20 points on 4 for 6 from the field and hit 10 free throws to pace Brooklyn to a 58-52 lead at halftime.The Nets struggled early and fell behind Chicago 15-7 midway through the first quarter. But Durant sparked a 20-10 run with 14 points of his own, including seven straight to put the Nets ahead 27-25 at the end of the period.Vaughn formed part of former coach Kenny Atkinson's staff in Brooklyn and replaced him as interim head coach on March 7, 2020. He coached the Nets to a 7-3 record before they were swept by the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs in the Walt Disney World bubble.He was an assistant under Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs from 2010-12 and then got his first lead coaching position with the Orlando Magic in 2012. Under Vaughn, the Magic missed the playoffs the first two years before he was fired 52 games into his third and final season.Bulls: Andre Drummond (shoulder contusion) did not play.Nets: G Seth Curry (left ankle - injury management) did not play.Bulls: Host the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night.Nets: Visit the Washington Wizards on Friday night for the start of a three-game road trip.AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shea Theodore scored at 1:35 of overtime to lead the Vegas Golden Knights to a 3-2 win over the Washington Capitals on Tuesday night.William Carrier and Jack Eichel also scored for the Golden Knights, who extended their winning streak to five games. Eichel added an assist, and Alex Pietrangelo helped set up all three Vegas goals, raising his assist total this season to nine. Logan Thompson made 19 saves.\"We're a veteran group, so we're never going to be out of the fight,\" Thompson said. \"These guys, they know how to win and (we were) confident coming in here after the second period that we were going to find a way to get two points tonight.\"Marcus Johansson and Trevor van Riemsdyk scored for Washington. Charlie Lindgren stopped 28 of 31 shots.After Washington and Vegas exchanged power-play goals in the opening period, van Riemsdyk broke the tie just 1:42 into the second, beating Thompson with a shot off the faceoff to make it 2-1. The goal was van Riemsdyk's first of the season and his first in 42 games dating to Jan. 28.With under six minutes to go in regulation, Carrier evened the score on a shot that banked off the right post and in. In overtime, Eichel made a great pass to Theodore, who walked in and beat Lindgren from close range for the winner and his third goal of the season.\"Great play. Obviously, he's a skilled player with the puck, and I think if you can kind of read through his eyes and get into a good spot, he'll find you,\" Theodore said of Eichel's pass on his OT winner.Thompson also held Washington's Alex Ovechkin without a goal. The Capitals' captain is one goal shy of tying Gordie Howe for the most single-team goals in NHL history. \"Obviously we know he's an OK player, right?\" Thompson said. \"No, obviously, he's got that shot, so that's something we clued in on. There's a reason why he's got 800-something goals. He's a scorer, and we did a good job taking him away.\"Washington earned a point but didn't leave unscathed, losing Beck Malenstyn to an upper-body injury after he made a diving block to stop a shot from the point. He joins a lengthy list of injured Capitals, including T.J. Oshie, Connor Brown, Nicklas Backstrom, Tom Wilson, Carl Hagelin and John Carlson.In the wake of more adversity, head coach Peter Laviolette wanted to see a better effort from Washington in the final 20 minutes of regulation, where he believed things started to fall apart for the injury-riddled club.\"I didn't like the way we played in the third period. I understand the circumstances, I understand the situation, but that doesn't mean you have to like the way we played the third,\" Laviolette said. \"I thought that we sat back, we left too many holes and we gave up a lot of chances ... not enough press and too many chances against.\"Connor Brown will be out six to eight months after ACL surgery. ...

(Anthony Quinn/WTNH-TV via AP)UNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) -- With the deadly ambush of two Connecticut police officers still fresh in voters' minds, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Stefanowski on Tuesday blamed a police reform law signed by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont for encouraging lawlessness as the pair met in the final debate of the race.The claim sparked a sharp rebuke from Lamont, who accused his opponent of politicizing the tragedy, calling it the \"cheapest grandstanding imagined.\"Besides the economy and inflation, crime has been a key issue in the rematch race between Lamont and Stefanowski. It has become more heated since three Bristol Police officers were shot Oct. 12 in what police believe was an ambush set up by a 911 call made by the shooter. Two Bristol officers died.Stefanowski recently began running a TV ad that features the wife of a police officer from another department who was seriously injured after being run down by repeat criminal. In the ad, the woman, whom Stefanowski pointed out in the debate audience, says she blames Lamont for the crime.Two years ago, Lamont signed into law a wide-ranging bill, proposed in the wake of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, that made numerous changes to policing in Connecticut. It created a new inspector general to investigate police use-of-force cases, limited circumstances in which deadly force is justified, and allowed more civilian oversight of police departments.The most contentious part of the new law, which sparked a protest at the state Capitol, allowed civil lawsuits against officers by individuals who have had their constitutional rights violated by police if those actions were deemed \"malicious, wanton or willful,\" among other things. Following Tuesday's debate, Stefanowski called it \"unconscionable\" for Lamont not to consider revamping the law after the two officers were killed.\"For him to not even consider, not even consider changing it, is crazy,\" said Stefanowski, who said he has heard from police officers who believe the legislation helped to create a culture of \"tolerance\" for criminals and a lack of respect for police officers. Stefanowski, who has been endorsed by multiple police unions in the state, accused Lamont of showing a \"lack of respect\" for law enforcement.Lamont said it was a \"horrible accusation\" for Stefanowski to say he doesn't care about officers.\"That's shocking. You know, I was there at Rentschler Field,\" he said referring to the stadium where a massive funeral was held for Bristol officers Dustin DeMonte and Alex Hamzy. \"I was there with 15,000 men and women in blue. I know exactly what that means. I just think you can't make those accusations. It's false and unfair and they're wrong.\"Rob Hotaling, the governor candidate on the Connecticut Independent Party ticket and the only biracial contender in the race, said he understands the safety concerns of police officers but also the safety concerns of people like him who have been racially profiled for crimes they didn't commit.\"When you go through that experience, you realize you take a different perspective on the police accountability bill,\" said Hotaling. He said he agreed with Lamont that Stefanowski was \"politicizing\" the issue.\"Police officers lost their lives. We need to respect that. But then you look at, OK, how do we make sure our communities are safe? Our police are safe? We should leave the politicization out of the way,\" he said. \"There's no room for that in a civil society.\" Follow AP's coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsCheck out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The Navy said it will ask the public how it should use a fuel storage facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor once it has finished draining petroleum from its massive storage tanks. (AP Photo/Audrey McAvoy)JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii (AP) -- The Navy on Tuesday said it will ask the public how it should use a fuel storage facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor once it has finished draining petroleum from its massive storage tanks. The Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor's tap water last year and sickened nearly 6,000 people, mostly those living in military housing.The Navy said it would seek permission from the state Department of Health to leave the tanks inside the hillside where they were built during World War II. Meredith Berger, assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment, told reporters at a news conference that it would be safer for the environment to leave the tanks in place once they are cleaned. The Navy also said leaving them there would allow them to be put to another use. The Navy hasn't determined what they will be used for yet, only that they won't be used to store fuel again. The Navy plans to ask the public for ideas through meetings and webinars. One possibility is to use the tanks to store water for a pumped hydoelectric power facility. \"We're very interested to hear what we can find and we'll go through a process to make sure that we're soliciting those good ideas,\" Berger said. The Navy is closing the facility in response to an order from the Department of Health after jet fuel spilled from the facility into a drinking water well in November. It expects to finish draining fuel from the tanks in July 2024. Berger said it will take another three years after they are drained to close the facility. Hawaii officials are worried that last year's leak, in addition to poisoning people, also contaminated an aquifer that Honolulu's water utility relies on to supply drinking water to 400,000 people on Oahu. That comes on top of contamination from other recorded leaks over the decades. The aquifer in question is located just 100 feet (30 meters) below the facility.Capt. Cameron Geertsema, the commander of Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Pacific, said the Navy has removed some contaminated soil already by using an excavator to dig it up and dispose of it as a hazardous substance. He said the Navy is working with private engineering firms to explore other decontamination methods including potentially soil vapor extraction. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, that involves drilling extraction wells into contaminated soil at least 3 feet (1 meter) below the surface but above the water table. A blower or vacuum pump attached to the well pulls air and vapors through the soil and above the ground for treatment. Geertsema said the Navy will be testing other methods within the year. \"The number one priority is is to remediate and remove any of the contamination in the soil right now,\" he said. The military is committed to that, from U.S. Pacific Fleet Adm. Samuel Papapro \"all the way up\" to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, he said. Kathleen Ho, the state Department of Health's deputy director for environmental health, said her agency will review the Navy's plan with a focus on ensuring that the facility is closed quickly and safely.\"Any closure plan must guarantee that the Navy will never reuse the Red Hill tanks for fuel or for other substances that threaten our aquifer,\" she said.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)MIAMI (AP) -- Upon review, Miami coach Erik Spoelstra had a good birthday. Jimmy Butler made sure of that.Butler scored five straight points late to give Miami the lead, Max Strus led everyone with 24 and the Heat overcame a triple-double from Stephen Curry to beat the Golden State Warriors 116-109 on Tuesday night.\"Huge for our confidence,\" Strus said.Butler scored 23 points, including a go-ahead three-point play with 1:48 left. Bam Adebayo scored 19, Duncan Robinson had 17 and Kyle Lowry 13 for Miami, which won on Spoelstra's 52nd birthday.Curry had 23 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists for the Warriors (3-5), who dropped their third straight and are 0-4 on the road. Andrew Wiggins added 21 points and Klay Thompson scored 19.\"I thought our energy was better at times,\" Golden State's Draymond Green said. \"But we've still got to put it together and win games.\"Curry had his 10th regular season triple-double. But a call that went Miami's way denied him a chance to tie the game with 1:39 left.Curry was hit on the hand by Butler as he tried a 3-pointer, with the Warriors down three. A foul was called, and Butler argued. That convinced Spoelstra to challenge the call.\"Just kind of went on a leap of faith,\" Spoelstra said.It worked. The referees determined Butler hit Curry on the hand after the ball was gone; Butler said he also hit the ball first.\"They had a high-five,\" referee Bill Kennedy said.Said Curry: \"You've got to be allowed to finish your motion. ... There was a lot of contact. But what do I know about calls?\"The Warriors didn't score again, and lost a game they led by 10 in the second half. Golden State's 20 turnovers were turned into 28 Heat points -- three of those turnovers being discontinued dribble calls against Jordan Poole.Warriors coach Steve Kerr said the NBA sent out an email Tuesday about that infraction. He didn't read it.\"The whole league does that,\" Kerr said. \"They've been doing it ever since Allen Iverson convinced the referees that it wasn't a carry. It is a carry. What Jordan does is a carry. But the whole league's been doing it. I guess I have to start checking my email on game days.\"Warriors: Curry extended his NBA-record streak of regular-season games with a 3-pointer to 197. He also owns the second-longest streak (157). ... The Warriors took 49 shots from 3-point range, 35 shots from 2-point range. ... Poole was minus-23 in 30 minutes.Heat: Lowry hit his 1,989th 3-pointer, passing Jason Kidd for 12th in NBA history. ... Spoelstra is now 6-2 on his birthday. ... Miami lost Tyler Herro midway through the second quarter after he got poked in the left eye by Golden State's Moses Moody on a rebound. Herro said he lost vision briefly, but it was back by postgame. ... The Heat were 20 for 20 from the line, tying the second-most without a miss in team history. They were 30 for 30 against Boston in 1993.Miami teammates Victor Oladipo (left knee) and Omer Yurtseven (left ankle), and Golden State's Andre Iguodala (left hip) all remained out. None have played this season.Iguodala played in 109 games for Miami, helped it to the 2020 NBA Finals and hasn't faced the Heat since.

All Rights Reserved.A voter casts their ballot at a secure ballot drop box at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt York)A voter casts their ballot at a secure ballot drop box at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt York)A voter casts their ballot at a secure ballot drop box at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt York)PHOENIX (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered armed members of a group monitoring ballot drop boxes in Arizona to stay at least 250 feet away from the locations following complaints that people wearing masks and carrying guns were intimidating voters.U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said members of Clean Elections USA, its leader and anyone working with them are also barred from filming or following anyone within 75 feet (23 meters) of a ballot drop box or the entrance to a building that houses one. They also cannot speak to or yell at individuals within that perimeter unless spoken to first. The temporary restraining order was requested by the League of Women Voters of Arizona after Clean Elections USA, encouraged people to watch 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County, Arizona's most populous county.\"It is paramount that we balance the rights of the defendant to engage in their constitutionally protected First Amendment activity with the interest in the plaintiffs and in voters casting a vote free of harassment and intimidation,\" Liburdi said.A second set of defendants in rural Yavapai County -- groups known as the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness team, who are associated with the far-right anti-government group Oath Keepers -- were dismissed from the case on Monday after they pledged to stand down their operations.Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in the two counties as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained alleging voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos, and followed voters.Sheriff's deputies have been providing security around the two outdoor drop boxes in Maricopa County after a pair of people carrying guns and wearing bulletproof vests showed up at a box in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. The county's other 24-hour outdoor drop box is at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in downtown Phoenix, which is now surrounded by a chain link fence.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, has called on voters to immediately report any intimidation to police and file a complaint with his office. Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs last week said her office received six cases of potential voter intimidation to the state attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a threatening email sent to the state elections director. The U.S. attorney's office in Arizona has vowed to prosecute any violations of federal law but said local police were at the \"front line in efforts to ensure that all qualified voters are able to exercise their right to vote free of intimidation or other election abuses.\" The temporary order issued by Liburdi on Tuesday will be in effect for two weeks and the cooperation from the monitoring group \"shall not be construed as an admission they have engaged in any of these activities,\" the judge added.The 250 foot (76 meter) perimeter around drop boxes also applies to group members wearing body armor.Other stipulations include the groups post on their websites and social media that it is untrue that dropping off multiple ballots is illegal in all cases. Exceptions are allowed for family members, members of the same household and caregivers.Alexander Kolodin, the lead attorney for the defendants, said the League of Women Voters of Arizona ultimately failed to completely shut down the monitors' mission. Still, the groups are not happy about the limits, since he said they could prevent them from discouraging ballot box stuffing. \"They're worried they can't record what happens within the 75 feet. They may have missed an opportunity to deter unlawful conduct,\" Kolodin said. \"Today's order may make drop box voting a little less secure.\"An Associated Press review this summer found no major fraud from the expanded use of ballot drops boxes in the 2020 election.The League of Women Voters of Arizona encouraged voters to keep using the drop boxes.\"Today's U.S. District Court decision is a victory for the voters of Arizona who have the right to cast their ballots free from intimidation, threats, or coercion,\" Pinny Sheoran, the group's president, said in a statement.This lawsuit was folded into another case before Liburdi. On Friday, the judge said Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans failed to make its argument against Clean Elections USA. Another defendant, Voto Latino, was also removed from the case.\"Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals,\" the judge wrote. Liburdi concluded that \"while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.\" The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. The Department of Justice on Monday said it would join the case, saying that the actions raised serious concerns about voter intimidation.Luke Cilano, a Lions of Liberty board member, said the organization had dropped its \"Operation Drop Box\" initiative last Wednesday \"due to being lumped in with people who don't adhere to the law and our rules of engagement.\"The Lions of Liberty are not associated with Clean Elections USA, he said. They are connected to the Yavapai County Preparedness Team. But he says the team was not involved in ballot box monitoring. Similar groups around the United States have embraced a film that has been discredited called \"2000 Mules\" that claims people were paid to travel among drop boxes and stuff them with fraudulent ballots during the 2020 presidential vote.There's no evidence for the notion that a network of Democrat-associated ballot \"mules\" has conspired to collect and deliver ballots to drop boxes, either in the 2020 presidential vote or in the upcoming midterm elections.This story has been corrected to show that the order does not apply to the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness Team, groups that were dismissed as defendants Monday after agreeing to stop their activities at drop boxes.Follow AP's coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsCheck out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Los Angeles judge declared a mistrial and dismissed grand theft charges Tuesday against a former business manager of Marvel Comics mastermind Stan Lee. Superior Court Judge George Lomeli dismissed the charges against Keya Morgan, who was accused of stealing from Lee, when a jury was deadlocked 11-1 in favor of acquittal after two days of deliberations and a 2 1/2-week trial. Lomeli said he was stepping in to clear Morgan of three felony counts of grand theft from an elder \"in the interests of justice,\" according to Variety. \"My client and I have spent four years proving his innocence and today we prevailed,\" Morgan's attorney Alex Kessel said in an email to The Associated Press. Prosecutors had alleged that Morgan, 41, stole more than 220,000 in proceeds from three memorabilia signings from Lee about six months before Lee died in 2018. Morgan was arrested the following year. Initial charges of elder abuse and false imprisonment against Morgan were dropped long before the trial. The prosecution argued during the trial that Morgan had preyed on Lee when Lee was in mental decline in the last months of his life, and acted without authority on his behalf. Kessel argued that the missing money actually went to Lee's daughter and heir J.C. Lee, who was a witness during the trial. The proceedings were largely overshadowed by the simultaneous trials of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and actor Danny Masterson, which were going on simultaneously with Morgan's on the same hallway of a downtown LA courthouse. An after-hours email sent to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office seeking comment was not immediately returned. Lee, the creative dynamo who co-created characters including Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk for Marvel and made beloved cameos in the movies that featured his creations, died in November of 2018 at age 95.

(AP Photo/Kyle Phillips)OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- For a few moments, it seemed like the glory days for the Oklahoma City Thunder.\"MVP! MVP!\" chants rained down for a Thunder player late in a win, like they often did during the Kevin Durant/Russell Westbrook era.This time, the chants were for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The new face of the franchise scored 13 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter, and the Thunder rallied from 15 points down in the second half to beat the Orlando Magic 116-108 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight win.Gilgeous-Alexander made all three of his field goals and 7 of 8 free throws in the fourth quarter. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Gilgeous-Alexander, the fifth-year guard who averages 31.5 points, could do even more.\"Great poise,\" Daigneault said. \"That's probably the thing that stands out about that stretch. I still don't think he's playing his best basketball for 48 at least, and I don't think he will (think so) either after tonight. But in the fourth quarter, for sure.\"Overall, Gilgeous-Alexander made 12 of 18 field goals and 10 of 11 free throws.\"He was tough,\" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. \"We knew that was how crafty and tricky he can be getting to the paint. Obviously, he hit some tough shots, hit some tough 2s.\"Aleksej Pokusevski added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 4-3 and have a winning record for the first time since nine games into the 2020-21 season.Wendell Carter Jr. tied a career high with 30 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, and Franz Wagner added 20 points for Orlando. Paolo Banchero, the No. 1 pick in the 2022 draft, had 15 points and eight rebounds.Orlando led 66-63 at halftime, then scored the first nine points of the third quarter. The Magic extended the lead to 86-71 with just under 5 minutes left in the third quarter. The Thunder chipped away, and Orlando led just 88-85 heading into the fourth.Pokusevski made a 3-pointer to give the Thunder a 105-104 lead with just over 4 minutes to play, and he later made a layup to put Oklahoma City ahead 109-106. Lu Dort hit a 3-pointer with 51 seconds remaining to put the Thunder up six and in control for good.\"That group at the end of the third really got us back in the game and just shifted the tone in the game a little bit,\" Daigneault said. \"And then the group down the stretch did a great job.\"The Thunder scored 30 points off 25 Orlando turnovers. \"You don't give yourself an opportunity,\" Mosley said. \"Those are lost possessions. We've got to learn to take care of the basketball in crunch time and understand the possession of the basketball is the most important thing, and we've got to do it by committee.\"Magic: C Mo Bamba was called for a technical in the second quarter. ... Orlando was issued a technical in the fourth quarter for a second delay of game. ... Outrebounded the Thunder 49-36. ... F Bol Bol had four blocks.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Kreider scored on a breakaway at 4:07 of overtime and Igor Shesterkin made 19 saves as the New York Rangers won their third straight game Tuesday night with a 1-0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.Carter Hart had stopped all 35 shots he faced and the Rangers hit the post four times before Kreider finally deposited a backhand after taking a pass from Mika Zibanejad, sending the Madison Square Garden crowd into a frenzy. Hart made five saves in OT before Kreider scored his fourth of the season and his 35th career game-winning goal, tying Steve Vickers for eighth-most in franchise history. \"It was loud all night. They were getting as frustrated as we were that pucks weren't going in,'' Kreider said of the fans. \"It was an exciting ending.\"The Flyers began the third period on a power play after defenseman Ryan Lindgren was assessed an extra two-minute roughing penalty after a scrum behind the Rangers net to conclude the second.New York had two power plays in the third - including one at 15:25 when former Rangers defenseman Tony DeAngelo was called for delay of game - but also failed to score. After a scoreless first in which the Rangers held a 9-7 shots advantage, the home team dominated the second but couldn't solve Hart.The 24-year-old Hart, who is 5-0-2 this season, stopped long shots from Rangers defensemen K'Andre Miller and Jacob Trouba early in the second, then turned away two one-timers by Zibanejad during a Rangers power play.Zibanejad also hit the post behind Hart 12 minutes into the second before Kreider had a short-handed breakaway later in the middle period and his shot struck the post flush to Hart's short side. The Rangers outshot the Flyers 14-4 in the second.Hart continued to vex the Rangers in the third, making a sharp pad save on a point-blank shot by Artemi Panarin 13 minutes into the stanza and a glove stop on Kreider at 14:52.\"It's a terrific start for Carter,'' Flyers coach John Tortorella said. \"They see Carter laying it out there. ... I hope it builds camaraderie.\"Shesterkin was also sharp, denying former Ranger Kevin Hayes from in front at 18:49 of the third. The shutout was Shesterkin's first this season and the ninth of his career. The Rangers netminder improved to 6-0-2 and his eight-game point streak is the second-longest to begin a season in team history behind Gilles Villemure (1971-72).\"He's our best player most every night and he certainly was tonight,'' Kreider said.The Rangers are 7-2-2 in their last 11 games against the Flyers. Last season, New York went 3-0-1 versus Philadelphia.\"The effort was there. Carter gives us a chance. We just didn't score,\" said Tortorella, in his first season behind the Flyers' bench. \"As long as I see effort and care and belief in what we're dong, I'm leaving the building in a decent mood. That's the way I feel right now.\"Philadelphia defenseman Justin Braun played his 800th career game. The 35-year-old blueliner, who skated in eight regular-season games and 19 playoff contests for the Rangers last season, rejoined the Flyers as a free agent in July. He has 197 points in 13 seasons with the Sharks, Rangers and Flyers.NOTES: The visit to Madison Square Garden was the only one this season for the Flyers. The teams meet Dec. 17 and March 1 in Philadelphia. ... The Rangers were without injured forwards Filip Chytil and Vitali Kravtsov. They scratched defenseman Libor Hajek. ... The Flyers were missing injured forwards James van Riemsdyk, Sean Couturier, Cam Atkinson and Patrick Brown. Philadelphia also scratched center Tanner Laczynski and defenseman Egor Zamula.Flyers: Visit the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday.Rangers: Host the Boston Bruins on Thursday night.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/APCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr)ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Kirill Kaprizov had two goals and Mason Shaw scored his second career goal in as many games, leading the Minnesota Wild to a 4-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night.Marc-Andre Fleury made 34 saves for Minnesota, which has earned points in six of its last seven games. The Wild have five wins in that stretch after losing the first three games of the season. Matt Boldy added an empty-net goal as Minnesota returned home after a five-game trip.\"We've got to win those games,\" Fleury said. \"It doesn't matter how long we've been gone. They've been on the road for a while too. We've got to find a way to dig deep. I think the start was important to be in the game and not be chasing after them. I think it paid off.\"Kaprizov's second multi-goal game of the season gives him eight for the season. He has scored four times in the last four games. Joel Eriksson Ek had a pair of assists for the Wild.Nick Suzuki scored a power-play goal in the third period and Jake Allen stopped 27 shots for Montreal, which had won two straight to start a four-game trip.\"I think we trust in the brand that we're trying to play,\" Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. \" ... We're going to generate chances and it showed in the past that we're able to crawl back in games, and tonight we just fell short. That's one thing I don't like about tonight's game is the result, because there was a lot of good things in this game.\"The Canadiens applied plenty of pressure early, outshooting Minnesota 15-7 in the first period. But, Montreal couldn't beat Fleury, who has settled in after a shaky start to the season. Fleury has allowed seven goals in winning four straight starts. He surrendered 11 in the season's first two games.After a scoreless first period, Shaw scored 1:09 into the second. Allen couldn't control the rebound on a shot by Eriksson Ek and Shaw tapped the rebound between Allen's legs.Shaw, a 23-year-old rookie, has been given a chance due to injuries to forwards Jordan Greenway, Marcus Foligno and Ryan Hartman. Minnesota and Kaprizov added two more goals in the second. Kaprizov's first goal was a deflection on a centering pass from Boldy on the power play.\"That's not his spot on the power play, but he knows that's a pretty good spot to go score a goal,\" Wild coach Dean Evason said of Kaprizov being in front of the net. The Wild have won 14 of the last 15 games against the Canadiens, including nine straight at the Xcel Energy Center.\"We were confident with our first two periods,\" Suzuki said. \"I felt like we outplayed for the whole game almost. Tough result for us, but I think the process is still really good.\"Minnesota lost forward Brandon Duhaime in the second with an upper-body injury. He left the game and never returned. Evason said after the game that \"it's not positive.\"Rookie forward Marco Rossi earned his first NHL point in his 11th career game with an assist on Kaprizov's second goalKaprizov and Rossi entered the zone on a 2-on-1 break. Kaprizov's pass across was deflected by the stick of a sliding David Savard into the air. Rossi knocked the puck down to Kaprizov, who quickly sent the puck past Allen.Montreal challenged the play for a high stick, but officials ruled that Rossi had played the puck legally.Canadiens: Play at Winnipeg Jets on Thursday.Wild: Host Seattle Kraken on Thursday.More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.SEATTLE (AP) -- Two foreign nationals from the Democratic Republic of Congo who pleaded guilty in federal court in Seattle to participating in a smuggling ring that brought illegal ivory, rhinoceros horn and pangolin scales into the U.S. have been sentenced.Herdade Lokua was sentenced to 20 months and Jospin Mujangi was sentenced to 14 months in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said. They both in July pleaded guilty to two counts of an 11-count indictment alleging they worked with a middle man to facilitate shipments of poached items into Seattle. The court determined Lokua was the organizer of a trafficking operation involving more than five other co-conspirators whose goal was to ship a cargo container full of elephant ivory, white rhinoceros horn and pangolin scales to Seattle. Mujangi helped package the wildlife products and handled the financial details to process the payment.Officials said the men acknowledged that from November 2019 through June 2021, they shipped 49 pounds (22 kilograms) of ivory from Kinshasa, arranging for the tusks to be cut into smaller pieces, painted black, and labeled as imported wood. In June 2021, they brought in rhino horns and discussed a shipment of ivory and pangolin scales, the Justice Department said.The men admitted they traveled from Congo to Seattle in November 2021 to meet in Edmonds with prospective buyers who were actually undercover federal agents. They were arrested after the meeting and indicted by a Seattle grand jury.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lance McCullers Jr. didn't have to look -- he had seen enough already.Rhys Hoskins had just lined a slider into the left-field seats for the Philadelphia Phillies' fifth home run -- five! -- to punctuate one of the most calamitous starts in World Series history Tuesday night.Only after hesitating did the 29-year-old Houston Astros right-hander turn for a peek. He really didn't have to.Bryce Harper, Alec Bohm, Brandon Marsh and Kyle Schwarber also went deep in the first five innings, 1,950 feet of long balls that powered Philadelphia to a 7-0 victory and a 2-1 Series lead.Of course the Phillies would have five of a kind -- they are, after all, a wild-card team.\"I don't really get hit around like that, so I was a little bit in disbelief,\" McCullers said, answering question after question for at least 10 minutes, telling a club official not to cut media off. Five years after winning Game 3 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, McCullers had a Charlie Brown-type outing, the first pitcher to allow five homers in any postseason game.\"Other than the homers, there was a lot of balls in the ground,\" he said, chuckling and realizing what he had just said.Was he tipping his pitches?\"I got whooped. End of story,\" he said. \"This has nothing to do with tipping.\" Schwarber walked leading off the first inning.\"We could all see he was kind of iffy from the start,\" Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos said.Speculation started soon after Harper hit a go-ahead, two-run drive with two outs in the first, sending a knuckle-curve 402 feet into the right-center field seats. McCullers did a 360 and hopped off the mound, not even waiting for the ball to land.\"Kind of a lazy curveball,\" catcher Martin Maldonado said.Harper said something to Castellanos and pointed a finger at his teammate's chest after crossing the plate.\"Guys are always looking for something, always looking to see if they're tipping their pitches,\" Astros manager Dusty Baker said. \"We didn't see anything.\"Harper then yelled \"Bohmer!\" before a quick chat with Bohm, who was on deck.\"Anytime you have information, you want to be able to give that to your teammates at any point,\" Harper said. \"Throughout the whole season we've done that.\" Bohm led off the second with the 1,000th homer in Series history, driving a sinker 373 feet into the left-field stands.Did Harper tell him anything?\"Maybe,\" Bohm said with a smile.Thirteen pitches later, Marsh sent a hanging slider soaring 358 feet and just over the right-center wall, where the ball dropped out of the glove of 10-year-old Ty Kuhner of Wilmington, Delaware, and bounced back onto the field. The home run call was upheld after a video review.Schwarber led off the fifth with the most majestic of the homers, launching a hanging changeup 443 feet off the shrubbery behind the center-field fence. McCullers crouched, then turned and watched with a pained look as the ball landed.\"It was kind of mind-boggling because he doesn't give up homers,\" Baker said.Pitching coach Bill Murphy visited the mound. Five pitches later, Hoskins reached out for a slider and drove it 374 feet into the front of the left-field stands. McCullers was pulled with a seven-run deficit.\"I don't feel like the 2-0 slider was a mistake to Marsh. I didn't feel like the changeup was a mistake,\" McCullers said. \"I didn't think the pitch to Harper was great -- that wasn't a great one. The 0-0 to Bohm was supposed to be away, it leaked in.

They believe in there.\"Pavel Zacha started the Bruins' comeback at 11:59 of the third when he deflected a shot behind Pittsburgh goaltender Tristan Jarry. Taylor Hall tied the game with 1:17 to play when he scored from the top of the crease.\"We weren't getting run out of the building by any means,\" Hall said. \"We felt that if we could claw back into the game, that we could put ourselves in a spot.\"Charlie Coyle scored his fourth, Brad Marchand added a power-play goal and Jakub Lauko scored his first NHL goal for the Bruins, who won their sixth straight game. Boston was the NHL's best team in October, as the Bruins opened the season 8-1, a franchise record through nine games.Linus Ullmark was pulled in the second period after allowing five goals on 23 shots. He re-entered the game in the third period and earned the win after Jeremy Swayman left with a lower body injury.\"To be able to overcome that in this building, against a really good team ... that speaks volumes about the guys in that dressing room,\" Montgomery said.Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Rickard Rakell all scored their fifth for Pittsburgh. Bryan Rust and Josh Archibald also scored for the Penguins, who lost their fifth straight game and first at home. Pittsburgh started the season 4-0-1, which included three lopsided home wins, before the recent skid, which started during a road trip through Western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. The teams will meet again January 2 during the NHL's Winter Classic at Fenway Park in Boston. Jarry made 34 saves.\"At the end of the day, we have to find a way to win,\" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. \"When you get a two-goal lead going into the third, you're in a good position to win. We had opportunities to win, but didn't take advantage of them.\"Crosby scored 30 seconds into the game and Coyle tied it for the Bruins at 5:18 of the first. Crosby established the most opening-minute goals in NHL history and Coyle scored his third in as many games.Lauko gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead at 13:20 with his first NHL goal and Malkin tied it for Pittsburgh at 1:47 of the second period.Then, Pittsburgh erupted with three goals in 2:54. Archibald put the Penguins back in front, 3-2, with a one-timer from the slot at 8:42. Rust scored at 11:16 from the side of the net and Rakell chased Ullmark 20 seconds later with a shot from the top of the circle.Patrice Bergeron scored 27 seconds after Rakell, but the goal was overturned on a coach's challenge because of goaltender interference. Marchand scored a power-play goal at 12:57, as Boston trailed 5-3 entering the third period.Crosby surpassed Hall of Famer Adam Oates for 18th place on the NHL's all-time points list.Crosby now has 1,421 points. Bryan Trottier is 17th in NHL history with 1,425 points.Crosby is one assist from becoming the 20th player in NHL to record 900 career assists. Crosby, who has played 1,118 career games, is on pace to become the sixth-fastest in NHL history to reach the milestone. Eight of the top 20 players on the NHL's all-time assists list have played for Pittsburgh.Mike Sullivan coached his 517th game with Pittsburgh on Tuesday. He surpassed Ed Johnston for most games coached in franchise history.Sullivan, who led Pittsburgh to back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017, is 301-160-56 with the Penguins. Sullivan, the second-longest tenured coach in the NHL, has the most wins in franchise history.Pittsburgh's Kris Letang and Boston's Charlie McAvoy, two of the NHL's top defensemen, didn't play on Tuesday.Letang missed with an illness, while McAvoy is working his way back from offseason shoulder surgery. McAvoy, a full practice participant on Monday, won't play on Boston's road trip, but the Bruins are hopeful to have him back in the lineup before Thanksgiving.Bruins F David Krejci missed his second game with an upper body injury. Pittsburgh F Teddy Blueger (upper body) missed his 10th game, while Jeff Carter sat out with a lower body injury.Also, Bruins D Derek Forbort left in the first period on Tuesday after blocking a shot.Bruins: Continue a four-game road trip at the New York Rangers on Thursday.Penguins: Travel to Buffalo on Wednesday.AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David J.

(AP Photo/David J. Phillip)PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bryce Harper bashed a home run on the first World Series pitch he saw in Philadelphia, and then figured out how the Phillies could hit a few more.The 330 million star offered quiet advice to Alec Bohm -- and then it got really loud in Philadelphia.As for those whispers in May that the Phillies were finished? Forget about 'em. The secret has long been out: these Phillies are for real. Now, they're two wins away from their first World Series championship since 2008.Harper hammered his sixth postseason home run, whispered an assist to Bohm before his solo shot and the Phillies tied a World Series record with five homers to rout the Houston Astros 7-0 Tuesday night and take a 2-1 Series lead.Brandon Marsh also homered, and Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins hit back-to-back shots in the fifth inning to chase Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. Philadelphia used the long ball to end the long wait for its first World Series home win since Game 5 of the 2009 World Series. Those Phillies couldn't finish the job.Ranger Suarez tossed three-hit ball over five shutout innings and inched this year's team closer to getting it done.Harper, Bohm, Marsh and the rest of the Phillies on the last team to qualify for the playoffs are two wins away from ending the season as the last team standing. With a sparkling 6-0 record at Citizens Bank Park this postseason, the Phillies just may not return to Texas.\"Just being back home, I think is such a momentum swing for us, just for the pure fact of our fan base,\" Harper said. \"This whole city is so excited to be in this moment, and we're just thrilled to be able to play in front of them and have this opportunity.\"Another red, raucous, resolute crowd of 45,712 let the Astros have it from the first pitch with chants of \"Cheater! Cheater!\" for Jose Altuve and \"Check the Bat! Check the Bat!\" for Martin Maldonado.The fans -- already amped from the jump after another sliding catch by right fielder Nick Castellanos in the first -- didn't wait long to go wild for the home run barrage.With leadoff hitter Schwarber on first base, Harper repeated his flair for playoff power when he ripped a two-run shot off McCullers into the right field seats for the fast lead. That made Harper 2 for 2 on home run swings in Philly -- he sent the Phillies to the World Series with a two-run drive in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series to beat San Diego.Harper crossed the plate and again exclaimed \"This is my house!\" before he ripped off his helmet, exposed his Phillie Phanatic headband and was mobbed by teammates in the dugout.Harper's homers shake the stadium to the point they should be measured on the Richter scale rather than in feet -- and they seem as automatic these days as a Phillie Phanatic spin on his ATV. Harper has hit four postseason homers that gave the Phillies the lead and showed that, yes, Bryce Bombs do go off in November, the first time more World Series games will be played in this month than October.Oh, and Harper might have a second career as a homer whisperer.Harper beckoned Bohm from the on-deck circle and back to the dugout for a quick word of advice. Maybe Harper saw McCullers tipping his pitches? \"I think any time you have information, you want to be able to give that to your teammates at any point,\" Harper said. \"Anytime I can help my teammates, throughout the whole season, we've done that.\" Whatever the quiet counseling was, it worked, and Bohm lined his first postseason homer leading off the second inning and the 1,000th in World Series history into the left field seats for 3-0 lead. So c'mon, Alec, fess up, what did Bryce tell you?\"That's between us,\" Bohm said with a shrug and a big smile.Marsh took the baton on the long-ball relay and knocked one into the right field seats that was dropped by a young kid from Delaware. The home run stood after a brief review -- as it seems nothing can interfere with Philadelphia's playoff push -- and it was 4-0.With that, McCullers had allowed four homers to his first nine batters. The right-hander who got his left triceps inked with nods to Houston got absolutely tattooed by the Phillies. \"It was kind of mind-boggling because he doesn't give up homers,\" Astros manager Dusty Baker said. \"He usually keeps the ball in the ballpark. He wasn't satisfied with it. We were very surprised by it.\"Schwarber, the NL home run champion, again dumped a two-run shot into a thicket of English ivy, Arborvitae and Holly beyond center field, and Hoskins connected on solo shot for a 7-0 lead that ended McCullers' night.McCullers became the first pitcher to give up five home runs in a World Series game.\"I don't really get hit around like that, so I was a little bit in disbelief,\" McCullers said.Suarez, the scheduled Game 4 starter before Game 3 was postponed a day by rain, delivered with the performance of his career and shut down the big bats in the AL champs' lineup. He needed only two pitches to get the first two outs of the game and struck out Yordan Alvarez to end the first. The few jams he got into, Suarez worked his way out, notably in the second when he whiffed Chas McCormick and left two runners stranded. He retired Altuve to end the fifth on a soft foul pop with two runners on base. \"He's just a guy with no heartbeat,\" catcher J.T. Realmuto said. \"It looks like he's playing a child's game.\"Suarez saved the Phillies from having to use ace relievers Jose Alvarado and Seranthony Dominguez as four relievers each tossed a scoreless inning to finish the five-hitter.\"It's a really good Houston team over there,\" Harper said. \"They have been here, they have been in all situations before and to be able to come in here and win the first game here was huge for us.\"Philly sports champions Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving, Brandon Graham and Bernie Parent threw first pitches to 2008 World Series champions Ryan Howard, Cole Hamels, Jayson Werth and Shane Victorino. Country music star Tim McGraw, son of the late Phillies reliever Tug McGraw, received a huge ovation and wore his dad's No. 45 McGraw jersey. McGraw closed the 1980 World Series with a strikeout. The Phillies send RHP Aaron Nola (2-1, 4.57 ERA in the postseason) to the mound against Houston RHP Christian Javier (1-0, 1.35 ERA) in Game 4. Nola was done after 4 1/3 innings in Game 1 of the World Series, though he retired the final six batters he faced and left in a tie game after the Phillies rallied from an early 5-0 deficit -- and won 6-5. Philadelphia plans to use RHP Noah Syndergaard in Game 5.More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ray Carlin)DALLAS (AP) -- Roope Hintz's second score of the game punctuated a three-goal flurry in 91 seconds and the Dallas Stars used four-goal outburst in the second period to beat the Los Angeles Kings 5-2 on Tuesday night.Hintz's goal at 10:31 of the second followed scores by Jason Robertson at 9:01 and Tyler Seguin at 10:17. Joe Pavelski added Dallas' fourth goal of the period at 18:37.Hintz also had an assist. Robertson, Jamie Benn and Miro Heiskanen each had two assists.Dallas' Scott Wedgewood stopped 30 shots to earn his first win of the season. It was Wedgewood's third start, but his first since No. 1 goalie Jake Oettinger suffered a lower-body injury on Saturday.Kevin Fiala and Arthur Kaliyev scored for the Kings, who were coming off a win at St. Louis a night earlier with four second-period goals. Cal Petersen made 35 saves for Los Angeles.Heiskanen, a first-pair defenseman, excelled in his first game back after missing three straight with an upper-body injury. That included two-way play and serving as point man on the power play that went 3 for 4.\"He's one of the best in the world for a reason,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"When he's out of the lineup, we're a different team.\"Heiskanen said it wasn't until Tuesday morning that he was confident he'd play.\"It was great to be back,\" he said. \"It was fun and a great win for the team.\"The Stars rebounded from Saturday's 6-3 defeat to the New York Rangers, their only loss in five home games.\"This league is all about response,\" DeBoer said. \"You're not going to be good every night. I think we really played well.\"Kings coach Todd McLellan was disappointed his team didn't come out mentally sharp for the second of the back-to-back set.\"If you don't have your legs, you'd better have your brains; we didn't have either,\" McLellan said. \"The three goals -- bang, bang, bang -- really put a dagger in us.\"Hintz opened the scoring 6:49 in with the first of three power-play goals for the Stars. The one-timer from the left circle followed Benn's backhand pass from behind the goal line. The goal snapped an 0-for-14 drought for Dallas' power play.Fiala tied the score at 5:21 of the second period off a rebound before the Stars' blitz began.Robertson's power-play goal was a one-timer from behind the right circle. Seguin scored on a wrist shot in the slot, and Hintz followed 14 seconds later on a breakaway.Kaliyev scored on the power play at 14:37 of the second to pull Los Angeles within 4-2, but Pavelski answered four minutes later on another man advantage.Oettinger, who leads the league in goals-against average at 1.40 and is second in save percentage (.952), is expected to be sidelined for at least a week.Stars defensemen Ryan Suter moved into third place in career games played by a U.S.-born defenseman at 1,290. He trails Chris Chelios (1,651) and Phil Housley (1,495).Kings rookie defenseman Brandt Clarke left the bench late in the game. McLelland said he thought Clarke was hit in the mouth. ... The Stars' 18 first-period shots were a high for any period this season. ... The Kings dressed 11 forwards and seven defensemen. ...

(AP Photo/David Banks)CHICAGO (AP) -- Brock Nelson had a goal and an assist to lead the New York Islanders past the Blackhawks 3-1 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight win after Chicago starting goalie Alex Stalock left early in the first period with a potential concussion.Anders Lee also scored and Zach Parise added an empty-netter for New York.Ilya Sorokin made 21 saves and lost a bid for his second shutout in three starts when Jonathan Toews scored a power-play goal on a deflection midway through the third period.The Islanders are on a roll after dropping three straight. They edged Chicago in a tight one after rallying from a three-goal deficit to beat defending Stanley Cup Champion Colorado 5-4 on Saturday.\"We're pleased with the progress,\" New York coach Lane Lambert said. \"It's never perfect and you always strive for better or more, but you at this point we just have to move on to the next game and try to improve.\"Rookie Arvid Soderblom stopped 28 of 30 shots after Stalock exited, but the Blackhawks generated few chances against tight-checking New York as they dropped their fourth straight (0-2-2).Nelson has four goals in three games after not scoring in his first seven. Sorokin has blocked 97 of the last 100 shots he's faced over three games, but credits his teammates.\"It's good for the goalie when the whole team helps you and can stop the puck with their bodies,\" Sorokin said.Stalock exited just 2:56 into the first after he was rammed into the right goalpost by Casey Cizikas. Stalock was placed in concussion protocol and will be re-evaluated on Wednesday.\"I think they said they're just going to let it settle for the night and see how he responds in the morning,\" Chicago coach Luke Richardson said. \"Right now, he's probably out.\"The Blackhawks were already without top goaltender Petr Mrazek, who has a groin injury. Soderblom is the only other goalie the team has under contract, so Chicago is searching for another.\"I'm sure they have calls in right now to (AHL farm team) Rockford,\" Richardson said. \"I don't know that they're going to do, but that's management's job to figure it out.\"Stalock stopped Cizikas' backhander as the forward cut in off right wing. Cizikas didn't slow down, colliding hard with Stalock and propelling him into the post.He remained sprawled on the ice for a couple of minutes, then skated to the bench and was replaced by Soderblom. Cizikas was assessed major penalty for goalie interference and a game misconduct.The Blackhawks generated little pressure and just four shots on the extended power play.Lee put New York ahead 1-0 during a power play with 2:25 left in the period, swatting in a loose puck inches from the goal line for his fifth goal. Kyle Palmieri's shot off the point was blocked in the slot by defenseman Jake McCabe. Nelson poked the puck under Soderblom and then Lee, who was parked in front, put it in.\"On the power play we've talked about getting some better looks and getting one to go through,\" Nelson said. Nelson made it 2-0 at 7:23 of the third, beating Soderblom from the right circle.Toews cut it to 2-1 at 3 minutes later with his sixth goal, deflecting in Caleb Jones' shot as he cut through the slot. Toews has a six-game point streak, with four goals and two assists.Parise sealed it with his empty-net goal with 14 seconds left,The Blackhawks hosted an elaborate celebration, complete with Native American dancers and music, before the game the United Center to kick off Native American Heritage Month.The Blackhawks got their name in 1926 from team owner Frederic McLaughlin in honor of the U.S. 86th Infantry Division, nicknamed the \"Black Hawk Division\" after a Native American chief from Illinois. McLaughlin served in the division in World War I.While some other sports teams with Native American themed names have come under pressure to change their names or logos, the Blackhawks have said they don't plan to.The Blackhawks placed top defenseman Seth Jones (broken right thumb) on injured reserve retroactive to Oct. 29 and recalled D Alec Regula from Rockford of the AHL. Jones, who leads Chicago with 25:12 of ice time per game, is expected to miss 3-4 weeks after being struck by a shot in a 4-3 loss at Buffalo on Saturday.Islanders: At St. Louis on ThursdayBlackhawks: Host Los Angeles on ThursdayCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

A decade ago, Konchok Dorjey gave up his pastoral life in search of a better future for his family. He sold off his animals and migrated to the urban settlement in the outskirts of Leh. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan)KHARNAK, India (AP) -- For decades, Konchok Dorjey grazed the world's finest cashmere-producing goats in the arid, treeless Kharnak village in India's Ladakh region, a high mountainous cold desert that borders China and Pakistan. But a decade ago, the 45-year-old nomad gave up his pastoral life in search of a better future for his family. He sold off his animals and migrated to an urban settlement in the outskirts of a regional town called Leh. Dorjey now lives with his wife, two daughters and a son in Kharnakling, where scores of other nomadic families from his native village have also settled in the last two decades.\"It was a tough decision,\" Dorjey said recently, sitting on the veranda at his home. \"But I did not have much choice.\"EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series exploring the lives of people around the world who have been forced to move because of rising seas, drought, searing temperatures and other things caused or exacerbated by climate change.As this region in Asia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, shifting weather patterns have already altered people's lives through floods, landslides and droughts in Ladakh, an inhospitable yet pristine landscape of high mountain passes and vast river valleys that in the past was an important part of the famed Silk Road trade route. Frequent loss of livestock due to diseases, lack of health care, border conflict and shrinking grazing land -- worsened by extreme climatic changes -- has forced hundreds to migrate from sparsely populated villages to mainly urban clusters in the region known for its sublime mountain landscape and the expensive wool.In the remote Himalayan region, glaciers are melting fast while still villagers largely depend on glacial runoff for water.Dorjey, the nomad-turned-cabbie, has seen it all.When growing up, Doriey said elders would often talk about moving somewhere else because there was so much snow that daily life was difficult.\"As I grew up, snow fell so little that we would contemplate leaving the place,\" Doriey said. He still stuck out there, herding some 100 cashmere goats, yak and sheep. But an illness of his younger daughter, Jigmet Dolma, now 18, changed the family's course.Dolma initially suffered from pneumonia. Then she had seizures and would often faint, sending the family some 100 miles (170 kilometers) north to Leh, where they would spend days for her treatment. As the family was yet to come to terms with her ailment, incurring losses to their livestock due to diseases and cold was draining them of their resources, Dorjey said.\"It was a cataclysmic year and extreme cold badly hit livestock. It just devoured large number of baby goats,\" he said. At about 15,000 feet altitude, the temperatures in the region can fall to minus 35 Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit) during long winter months.In 2011, Dorjey locked his stone house and left Kharnak for good. He painstakingly built his new life in Kharnakling and now drives a taxi for a living. The health of his daughter Dolma has improved while the two other children are studying.\"Ultimately, it boils down to safeguarding your family,\" he said as he took a deep breath.\"Urban life has brought its own issues and almost everything runs on money,\" he said as he explained his earlier predicaments of new life. \"Life was much easier there (in Kharnak) with all its hardships.\"Dorjey's wife, Sonam Kunkhen, expressed contentment about their flight from old village.\"It's better here for me and my family,\" the 47-year-old woman said. \"It took us a while to adjust, but I'm glad we moved here.\" On a recent sunny day, Dorjey drove to his native village Kharnak where he met his maternal uncle, Tsering Choldan. The 64-year-old nomad announced to him that he too was leaving soon. Other shepherds were also packing up their bags.Dorjey pointed out that the village in recent years had received considerable attention as authorities built some prefab huts for nomads and spruced up animal feed facilities. But he said he was skeptical by experience that such facilities would stop migration.\"There are some facilities that were not there when I was living here. But there are also some other regressive changes that have occurred,\" Dorjey said.The worst, he said, is unpredictability of the weather and shortage of water in recent years.Many of Kharnak's pasturelands have become barren owing to unusual weather in recent years. And the multiple glaciers that covered the surrounding high peaks have shrunk drastically in last two decades causing water shortages, the shepherds said.\"Few small ones that rested on mountain peaks in my years of nomadic life have now almost entirely disappeared,\" Dorjey said pointing to a barren mountain range in Kharnak.Dubbed as a part of water tower of Asia, Ladakh is home to thousands of glaciers, including Siachen glacier that is the longest outside the Polar region. Some of the region's glaciers also feed the Indus Basin Irrigation System, one of the world's largest that services India and China and considered a lifeline for agricultural land in Pakistan.But they are receding at an alarming rate, threatening the water supply of millions of people.In recent years, the changes on the ground are visually stark.There are some fruit and vegetables, like apple and broccoli, now grown in the region due to favorable weather conditions. About a decade and a half back such farming was unheard of.Bird watchers now spot winged creatures like paradise flycatcher and Eurasian scops owl that don't belong to the region. At the same time some native wildlife like Tibetan antelope or Ladakh urial are disappearing from the region's landscape.The ongoing military standoff between India and China has witnessed deployment of tens of thousands of additional soldiers to the already militarized region and has led to massive infrastructure development in recent years. It has in turn increased localized pollution manifold, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels like coal and kerosene, and wood for heating shelters to keep soldiers warm in freezing temperatures.Dorjey said some places in the region \"still receive a regular snowfall, but it melts fast,\" an indication of what experts point out to Ladakh's warming weather.A quiet flight of nearly 100 nomadic families from the village has dwindled its population to just 17 families who herd some 8,000 animals. While food security, health care and education are at the heart of their migration, the worsening climatic conditions exacerbated their flight.Among the former Kharnak dwellers, most aging and old people are nostalgic about their old village. But they're mostly ones who have lived their productive years of life and now sit inside their homes or assemble in prayer halls or roadside shops to reminisce about what they've lost and gained.Dorjey's eldest daughter, 21-year-old Rigzen Angmo, has visited Kharnak only twice. \"I would like to visit there once in a while. Just that. There is not much for me there,\" said Angmo who is an undergraduate business commerce student.The other lot, mostly young, are largely apathetic. Most of them want to do anything but shepherd animals high in the mountains. Many of them are working in government offices, run their own businesses or do menial jobs with the Indian military.Sitting on bank of a brook in Kharnak, Dorjey said he can't take the nomad out of himself.\"It was the hardest decision in my life to leave my village. My soul is still here,\" he said. But he also acknowledged he was thinking less and less of returning as \"urban life has possessed and softened me.\"\"On practical terms also, Kharnakling has better food and health facilities. Weather is not as harsh,\" he said. Follow Aijaz Hussain on Twitter at twitter.com/hussain_aijazAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila)MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Millions of students trooped back to public schools across the Philippines on Wednesday as the government enforced the mandatory resumption of in-person classes after more than two years of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.Daunting problems hounded the reopening of classes in grade and high schools in several cities and provinces -- primarily the extensive damage and flooding caused by Tropical Storm Nalgae, which blew out of the archipelago on Sunday. The storm left more than 130 people dead and a trail of destruction, including damaged school buildings.Shortages in teachers and classrooms have also been a longstanding problem.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has taken steps to fully reopen the economy, which plunged in 2020 to its worst recession since World War II after his predecessor shut down schools, workplaces and public transport to combat spiking coronavirus infections in what would become one of the world's longest lockdowns.Marcos Jr. has lifted the mandatory requirement for people to wear face masks in public areas and indoors.Nearly 29 million students enrolled for the school year, including in privately owned schools, which can decide whether to resume in-person classes or maintain a mix of face-to-face or online classes each week.Many schools resumed in-person classes in August at the start of a transition period to normal classes. The prolonged school closures had sparked fears that literacy rates among Filipino children -- already at alarming levels before the pandemic -- could worsen.A World Bank study last year showed about nine out of 10 children in the Philippines were suffering from \"learning poverty,\" or the inability of children by age 10 to read and understand a simple story.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/James Elsby)Bangladesh's Litton Das reacts after he was run out during the T20 World Cup cricket match between India and Bangladesh in Adelaide, Australia, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/James Elsby)ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) -- India moved in sight of the T20 World Cup semifinals by beating Bangladesh by five runs in a rain-affected thriller on Wednesday thanks to another impressive knock by Virat Kohli and an unfortunate run-out of Litton Das in the chase.Kohli continued his strong form at the tournament by scoring 64 not out off 44 balls to help India to 184-6 off its 20 overs. Lokesh Rahul also weighed in with a 32-ball 50. Bangladesh started its reply brilliantly and was 66-0 after seven overs -- with Das on 59 off 26 balls -- when the teams were forced off for nearly an hour because of rain. The revised target was set at 151 in 16 overs, according to the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method.Off the first ball after the delay, Das slipped as he turned for a second run and appeared to hurt his arm. Then, off the next ball, he again slipped as Bangladesh sought a second run and was run out for 60 at the non-striker's end from a direct throw by Rahul.It proved the turning point as Bangladesh was restricted to 145-6, with Arshdeep Singh taking 2-38.\"It was a closer game than we would have liked,\" said Kohli, who was named man of the match.\"It was another good day with the bat. I am happy the World Cup is in Australia because I can play my shots here. I love playing in Adelaide. I feel at home and want to keep batting.\"India climbed above South Africa to the top of Group 2 in the Super 12s with six points from four games. Second-place South Africa plays fifth-place Pakistan in Sydney on Thursday in a match that will have major implications for the group.Bangladesh, which is third on four points, will play Pakistan in its final game. Before the rain break, Das was putting India's pace attack to the sword. He hit three sixes and seven fours, reaching his half-century off 21 balls. It was the second quickest half-century of the tournament.He put on 50 runs off 32 balls, with Najmul Shanto only contributing three runs to the initial partnership. Overall, they put on 68 runs off 44 balls either side of the weather interruption.When the rain intervened, Bangladesh was ahead on DLS, having needed a par score of 49-0 at that point.Afterward, however, Bangladesh plunged to 99-3 after Suryakumar Yadav held two sharp catches to send back Shanto (21) and Afif Hossain (3) in quick succession.Shakib al Hasan was out for 13, while Nurul Hasan kept Bangladesh going with 25 not out off 14 balls.With 20 needed off the last six balls, Singh helped to seal the win for India.Earlier, put in to bat, India had Rohit Sharma dismissed for 2, despite surviving a dropped catch.Kohli and Rahul then added 67 runs off 36 balls for the second wicket.Rahul was the aggressor in the partnership as he struck four sixes and three fours. He brought up his first half-century of the tournament off 31 balls.Shakib (2-33) got rid of Rahul immediately after his milestone. Kohli then added another 38 runs with Yadav, who hit 30 off 16.Shakib bowled Yadav as well, leaving India at 116-3 in 13.3 overs. India lost a flurry of wickets toward the end, falling to 150-5 in 17 overs.Kohli hit eight fours and one six, and reached his third half-century of the tournament off 37 balls.India scored 54 off the last five overs, despite losing Hardik Pandya (5) and Dinesh Karthik (7) cheaply.Ravichandran Ashwin scored a handy 13 not out off six balls.In the first game of the day, also in Adelaide, fast bowler Paul van Meekeren took three wickets to lead the Netherlands to a five-wicket win over Zimbabwe, ending the African side's chances of making the semifinals.It was the Dutch side's first win in the Super 12 tournament after three losses. Van Meekeren (3-29) and his pace partners Brandon Glover (2-29) and Bas de Leede (2-14) were influential in curtailing the Zimbabweans, who were dismissed in 19.2 overs for 117 after winning the toss and deciding to bat. In reply, the Netherlands scored 120-5 with 12 balls remaining.

The Federal Reserve may reach a turning point this week as it announces what's expected to be another substantial three-quarter-point hike in its key interest rate. The Fed's hikes have already led to much costlier borrowing rates, ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sought Wednesday to strike a delicate balance at a moment when high inflation is bedeviling the nation's economy and commanding a central role in the midterm elections.Powell suggested that the Fed may decide in coming months to slow its aggressive interest rate increases. Yet he also made clear that the Fed isn't even close to declaring victory in its fight to curb an inflation rate that is near four-decade highs and has shown few signs of ebbing.When the Fed ended its latest policy meeting Wednesday, it announced that it was pumping up its benchmark rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a fourth straight time. Its key rate now stands in a range of 3.75 to 4, the highest in 15 years.It was the central bank's sixth rate hike this year -- a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive and heightened the risk of a recession.The statement the Fed issued suggested that it would begin to take a more deliberate approach to rate hikes, likely leading to smaller increases in borrowing costs. In doing so, it would consider that rate hikes take time to feed into the economy and achieve their goal of slowing inflation. The financial markets initially cheered the notion that the Fed might soon decide to slow its hikes, with stock and bond prices surging higher. Yet as his news conference got under way, Powell struck a harder line. He stressed that the Fed's policymakers have seen little progress in their efforts to control inflation and would likely have to send rates even higher than they thought they would at their last meeting in September. \"We still have some ways to go,\" he said. \"Incoming data since our last meeting suggests\" that the officials might have to raise rates higher than the 4.6 they forecast in September. The Fed chair pointedly emphasized that it would be \"very premature\" to even think about halting the rate hikes. Inflation pressures, he said, remain far too high.The abrupt shift in tone gave the financial markets whiplash. Stocks sharply reversed their gains and tumbled into the close of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down over 500 points, or about 1.5. \"I think he accomplished his goal\" of striking hawkish and dovish notes, said Vince Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon. (\"Hawks\" generally prefer higher rates to fight inflation, while \"doves\" often lean more toward lower rates to support hiring.) \"That's why the market was so confused.\"The Fed's meeting occurred as financial markets and many economists have grown nervous that Powell will end up leading the central bank to raise borrowing costs higher than needed to tame inflation and will cause a painful recession in the process. Powell implicitly addressed those fears at his news conference. He kept the door open to downshifting to a half-point hike when the Fed next meets in December. The central bank could then step down even further to a quarter-point increase -- a more typically sized rate hike -- early next year.\"At some point,\" he said, \"it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made.\"At the same time, Powell noted that the job market remains strong, which means many businesses must raise pay to keep workers -- raises that are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This week, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply, which also fuels bigger pay increases and adds to inflationary pressures. Overall, Powell said the Fed has made little progress against inflation so far. \"We think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates,\" he continued, \"before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive.\" The persistence of inflated prices and higher borrowing costs is pressuring American households and has undercut the ability of Democrats to campaign on the health of the job market as they try to keep control of Congress. Republican candidates have hammered Democrats on the punishing impact of inflation in the run-up to the midterm elections that will end Tuesday.\"Chair Powell stuck to this two-pronged message: We're not done yet, due to high inflation and a strong commitment to bring it down,\" Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets Economics, wrote in a note. \"But we may not need to keep cranking rates aggressively, due to an economy that has slowed significantly from last year and long-term inflation expectations that are still 'well anchored.' \"Typically, the Fed raises rates in quarter-point increments. But after having miscalculated in downplaying inflation last year as likely transitory, Powell has led the Fed to raise rates aggressively to try to slow borrowing and spending and ease price pressures.The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14 a year ago, surpassed 7 last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months. Still, the policymakers may feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes because some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.Outside the United States, many other major central banks are also rapidly raising rates to try to cool inflation levels that are even higher than in the U.S.Last week, the European Central Bank announced its second consecutive jumbo rate hike, increasing rates at the fastest pace in the euro currency's history to try to curb inflation that soared to a record 10.7 last month.Likewise, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates Thursday to try to ease consumer prices, which have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years, to 10.1 in September. Even as they raise rates to combat inflation, both Europe and the U.K. appear to be sliding toward recession.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally, Oct. 9, 2022, in Mesa, Ariz. Trump has been teasing another presidential run since before he left the White House. But aides to the former president are now preparing for a 2024 campaign that could be announced soon after next week's midterms. (AP Photo/Matt York, File)NEW YORK (AP) -- As he played to a crowd of supporters in Robstown, Texas, former President Donald Trump drew cheers as he talked up his first two runs for the White House -- and teased a third.\"In order to make our country successful, safe and glorious again, I will probably have to do it again,\" he said last month.That carefully placed \"probably\" may soon be gone from Trump's stump speech. Aides to the former president are making quiet preparations for a 2024 presidential campaign that could be launched soon after next week's midterm elections as Trump tries to capitalize on expected Republican wins to propel himself toward becoming the front-runner for his party's nomination.\"I'm like 95 he's going to run,\" said Reince Priebus, Trump's former White House chief of staff. \"The real question,\" he added, \"is are other big challengers going to run? If President Trump runs, he will be very difficult for any Republican to defeat.\"Another campaign would be a remarkable turn for any former president, much less one who made history as the first to be impeached twice and remains embroiled in multiple and intensifying criminal investigations, including probes of classified information held at his Mar-a-Lago club and his effort to pressure election officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump has a history dating back to the 1980s of publicly toying with White House bids only to back down.But Trump, according to people close to him, is eager to be back in the political game. While he has been talking up a bid since before he left the White House, aides and allies are now eyeing the two-week stretch after the Nov. 8 midterms as a possible window for an announcement, though they caution that he hasn't made a decision and that -- as always when it comes to Trump -- things could change, particularly if the election results are delayed due to recounts or a possible runoff election in Georgia.Indeed, even as discussions are underway about potential venues and dates for a formal announcement, Trump continues to tease the possibility of declaring his intentions at one of the rallies he's planned for the election's homestretch.The preparations come as Trump has been stepping up his efforts to help midterm candidates in the election's final weeks, hoping to piggyback off expected Republican gains in Congress to build momentum for his own campaign.Trump has dramatically ramped up his spending after facing criticism for failing to financially help his favored candidates while continuing to vacuum up small-dollar donations. His newly launched MAGA Inc. super PAC has now spent more than 16.4 million on ads in a handful of competitive states, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact, with additional investments expected through Election Day, according to people familiar with the effort, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations.And Trump continues to hold events to bolster his candidates, with 30 rallies so far in 17 states, along with dozens of virtual rallies and more than 50 candidate fundraisers. His final midterm rally blitz will take him to Ohio and Pennsylvania, two crucial presidential voting states where his endorsements helped candidates secure their nominations. He'll also return to Iowa, which holds the first contest of the presidential nominating calendar.In total, Trump's Save America PAC says he has raised nearly 350 million this election cycle for Republican candidates and party committees, including online fundraising solicitations.While Trump's team has been identifying potential staff prospects in key states and drawing up paperwork to file should he move forward with an announcement, according to people familiar with the planning, one stressed that hiring has not yet commenced. Trump's campaign, at least in its early months, is expected to remain headquartered in Florida and look much like his current political operation, overseen by the small clutch of advisers he's fostered since leaving office -- reminiscent of his famously threadbare 2016 campaign.Chris LaCivita, the Republican strategist who was behind the \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" campaign that badly damaged Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential prospects, is working for Trump's super PAC and expected to take on a senior leadership role in the campaign operation, according to people familiar with the conversations, as is Susie Wiles, the longtime Florida operative who has been overseeing his political efforts.The 2024 campaign will effectively kick off when the polls close on Nov. 8, and potential challengers have spent months carefully laying the groundwork for their own expected campaigns. That includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely seen as Trump's most formidable challenger and who has been cultivating a deep donor network as he runs for reelection.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton have been aggressively stumping for midterm candidates, as have former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.Trump, meanwhile, faces mounting challenges. He remains a deeply polarizing figure, particularly after spending the last two years spreading lies about the 2020 election. And while Trump remains overwhelmingly popular among Republicans, an October AP-NORC poll found 43 said they don't want to see him run for president in 2024.Underscoring that polarization, many in Trump's orbit had urged him to wait on an announcement until after the midterms to avoid turning the election into a referendum on him.Others close to Trump remain skeptical that he will ultimately go through with another run, contending that his ego can't take another loss or fearing a possible indictment. Others question whether he will ultimately end up on the ballot in 2024, even if he does launch a campaign.Campaigns also need staff and Trump's orbit has shrunk considerably over the last two years. Many former aides are expected to steer clear of another effort either because they have broken with Trump, have moved on, or are fearful that involvement could expose them to potential legal scrutiny -- and lawyers' bills.For someone on the verge of launching a presidential campaign, Trump also remains unusually distracted by legal threats.There is the Justice Department's intensifying investigation into how hundreds of documents with classified markings ended up at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. State prosecutors in Georgia continue to probe his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as do the DOJ and the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack, which recently served him a subpoena demanding testimony.In New York, Attorney General Letitia James has sued Trump, alleging his namesake company engaged in decades of fraudulent bookkeeping. The Trump Organization is now on trial for criminal tax fraud charges, and Trump recently sat for a deposition in a lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump denies the allegations.All the while, Republicans across the country, from high-dollar donors to longtime GOP leaders and rank-and-file voters, have been considering whether they want to stick with Trump.At a recent Iowa Republican Party fundraiser headlined by Pence, voters praised Trump's time in office but were mixed on whether they want him to mount another campaign.\"I'd like to see him run again,\" said 81-year-old Jane Murphy, a longtime county Republican volunteer who lives in Davenport. \"He makes me angry with some of the things he says. But he gets the job done, plain and simple.\"But Carol Crain, an eastern Iowa GOP activist, voiced reservations.\"I think a lot of Republicans are just tired of the drama and the fighting,\" said Crain, 73. \"It's really wearing. Under their breath, people say it would be nice if he could endorse somebody and go away with grace.\"Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wis., and Thomas Beaumont in Wilton, Iowa, contributed to this report.Follow the AP's coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

All Rights Reserved.Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz formally received a sentence of life without parole on Wednesday after families of his 17 slain victims spent two days berating him as evil, a coward, a monster and a subhuman who deserves a painful death. (Nov.3)FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz formally received a sentence of life without parole Wednesday after families of his 17 slain victims spent two days berating him as evil, a coward, a monster and a subhuman who deserves a painful death.Cruz, shackled and in a red jail jumpsuit, showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer pronounced one-by-one 34 consecutive life sentences -- one each for the slain and the 17 he wounded during the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in suburban Fort Lauderdale. The judge's voice broke as she read the first sentences, but she gained strength and volume she moved down the list. Scherer had no other choice in sentencing; the jury in Cruz's three-month penalty trial voted 9-3 on Oct. 13 to sentence him to death, but Florida law requires unanimity for that sentence to be imposed.Scherer made no comments directed at Cruz beyond what was legally required. Instead, the judge commended the victims' families and the wounded, calling them strong, graceful and patient.\"I know you are going to be OK, because you have each other,\" Scherer said.Some parents and other family members of the slain wept as she spoke. When she finished and Cruz was led from the courtroom, one father muttered \"Good riddance.\" They then gathered into groups and hugged each other.Cruz, 24 and a former Stoneman Douglas student, pleaded guilty last year to the massacre, where he stalked a three-story classroom building for seven minutes, firing 140 shots with a semi-automatic rifle. He will be taken within days to the Florida prison system's processing center near Miami before he is assigned to a maximum-security facility. Experts say he will likely be placed into protective custody, perhaps for years, before he is released into the prison's general population.The sentencing came after the families and the wounded spent two days verbally thrashing Cruz while mourning their loved ones. Many wished him a painful demise and lamented that he could not be sentenced to death. Others said that after leaving court Wednesday, they would try not to think of him again. \"Real justice would be done if every family here were given a bullet and your AR-15 and we got to pick straws, and each one of us got to shoot one at a time at you, making sure that you felt every bit of it,\" Linda Beigel Schulman said. Her son, teacher Scott Beigel, was shot in the back as he led students to safety in his classroom. She told him that his fear would mount, \"until the last family member who pulled that last straw had the privilege of making sure that they killed you.\"Fred Guttenberg told the court that last week he finally watched the security video of the shooting, witnessing his 14-year-old daughter Jaime get to within one step of a stairway door and safety when Cruz's bullet hit her in the spine. \"I saw you enjoy it,\" he told Cruz. He said he then went to Jaime's grave and asked her for guidance. \"I walked away from the cemetery realizing that no matter the verdict, nothing changed. Jaime is still in the cemetery,\" he said. \"I am still a dad who every day dreamed of walking his daughter down the aisle and now I have to face a lifetime of reality that I won't.\"Victoria Gonzalez, whose boyfriend Joaquin Oliver was murdered as he lay wounded on the floor, told Cruz she had once sat near him in a class. She told him she felt sorry every day for him then, knowing that he struggled. His attorneys said that his birth mother's heavy drinking left him with brain damage -- an assertion the prosecution and the families rejected.\"I was rooting for you,\" Gonzalez told Cruz, telling him she would cross her fingers when the teacher asked him a question, hoping he would get it right and feel accomplishment. Back then her life was happy, she had friends: \"Joaquin loved me for all my flaws.\" Now, she says, because of what Cruz did, she can no longer get close to anyone because she fears loss, no matter what her outside appearance says.\"I do blame you -- not you alone -- but definitely you,\" she said. She recalled listening to a medical examiner describing Oliver's gruesome head wound. \"I will live with that -- and you will live with that indifferently.\"Several parents over the two days said they would petition the Legislature to change the state's death penalty law so that jury unanimity is no longer needed for a judge to impose a death sentence. \"Do we now have closure? Let me be clear, absolutely not,\" said Dr. Ilan Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was killed when Cruz fired into her classroom. \"What I see is that the system values this animal's life over the 17 now dead. Worse, we sent the message to the next killer out there that the death penalty would not be applied to mass killing. This is wrong and needs to be fixed immediately.\"Associated Press writers Freida Frisaro and David Fischer in Miami contributed to this report. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Tough prison sentences that Saudi Arabia has handed the Saudi student and a Saudi-American citizen suggest Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is maintaining or escalating a crackdown on Saudi dissidents in the West, Saudi exiles and rights groups say. The Saudi prince who was attending graduate school in Boston is the latest person targeted as part of what the FBI and others say is Saudi Arabia's crackdown on Saudis in the United States. (AP Photo)WASHINGTON (AP) -- A graduate student at Boston's Northeastern University, Prince Abdullah bin Faisal al Saud seldom mentioned he was a member of Saudi Arabia's sprawling royal family, friends say. He avoided talking about Saudi politics, focusing on his studies, career plans and love of soccer.But after a fellow prince -- a cousin -- was imprisoned back home, Prince Abdullah discussed it with relatives in calls made from the U.S., according to Saudi officials, who somehow were listening. On a trip back to Saudi Arabia, Prince Abdullah was imprisoned because of those calls. An initial 20-year sentence was hiked to 30 years in August.Prince Abdullah's case, detailed in Saudi court documents obtained by The Associated Press, hasn't been previously reported. But it's not isolated. Over the last five years, Saudi surveillance, intimidation and pursuit of Saudis on U.S. soil have intensified as the kingdom steps up repression under its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to the FBI, rights groups and two years of interviews with Saudis living abroad. Some of those Saudis said FBI agents advised them not to go home.The Saudi Embassy in Washington, responding to an inquiry by the AP, said, \"The notion that the Saudi government -- or any of its institutions -- harasses its own citizens abroad is preposterous.\"But in the same month that Prince Abdullah's sentence was lengthened, Saudi Arabia gave a 72-year-old Saudi-American, Saad al Madi, a virtual life sentence for tweets he had posted from his home in Florida. Al Madi was unexpectedly accused and imprisoned on a visit home to the kingdom. In sentencing al Madi, the kingdom split from a longstanding Saudi practice of sparing citizens of the U.S., its longtime military protector, from the worst of punishments.Also in August, it gave a 34-year prison sentence to a 34-year-old Saudi student in Britain, Salma al Shehab, when she, too, visited the kingdom after tweeting about it.All three sentences were imposed weeks after President Joe Biden set aside his past condemnation of Saudi Arabia's human rights record to travel to the kingdom, despite criticism from lawmakers, rights groups and Saudi exiles. It was a moment when the U.S. urgently needed the kingdom to keep up oil production. But Biden has ended up with no more oil -- the Saudis and OPEC have cut production -- or any improvement in human rights. Saudi rights advocates say the imprisonments validate their pre-trip warnings: Biden's attempts to soothe the crown prince have only emboldened him. Several authoritarian governments illicitly monitor and strike out against their citizens in the United States, often in violation of U.S. sovereignty, in what's called transnational repression. Many of the cases the U.S. prosecutes involve rivals, particularly China.But Saudi Arabia's actions under Prince Mohammed stand out for their high-tech intensity, orchestration and, often, ferocity, and for coming from a strategic partner.Freedom House, a research and advocacy group, says Saudi Arabia has targeted critics in 14 countries, including targeting coordinated and run from the United States. The aim is to spy on Saudis and intimidate them, or compel them to return to the kingdom, the group says.\"It's disturbing, it's terrifying, and it's a major violation of protected speech,\" Freedom House's Nate Schenkkan said of the recent imprisonments of Western-based Saudis.In its statement rejecting claims it targets critics abroad, the Saudi Embassy said: \"On the contrary, our diplomatic missions abroad provide a broad array of services, including medical and legal assistance, to any citizen that requests assistance when traveling outside the kingdom.\" The statement did not address the imprisonment of the Boston-based prince.The State Department said it was looking into Prince Abdullah's case. In an email, it called transnational repression in general \"an issue of significant human rights and national security concern\" and said it would keep pursuing accountability. It did not directly address any questions about Saudi actions.The FBI declined to comment.Prince Abdullah, 31, comes from one of the branches of the royal family most targeted by detentions as perceived critics or rivals since Prince Mohammed consolidated power under his aged father, King Salman.A photo from Prince Abdullah's Northeastern undergraduate ceremony shows him in cap and gown, clean-shaven, chin lifted and beaming.Friends say Saudi officials took Prince Abdullah into custody after he returned in 2020, on a government-provided ticket, to study remotely during the pandemic.Saudi courts sentenced him to 20 years in prison and a subsequent 20-year travel ban. A Saudi court in August lengthened the term by 10 years.As with others it imprisoned, including writers, journalists and advocates, Saudi Arabia accused Prince Abdullah of acting to destabilize the kingdom, disturb social unity and support the kingdom's opponents. The kingdom uses terrorism and cybercrime laws -- applied in cases involving phone or computer communication -- to issue unusually tough sentences.Saudi court documents allege Prince Abdullah used a Signal app on his mobile phone in Boston to speak to his mother and other relatives about the cousin imprisoned by Prince Mohammed, and had used a public phone in Boston to speak to a lawyer about the case. They say Prince Abdullah acknowledged sending about 9,000 euros (9,000) to pay bills at his cousin's apartment in Paris.It is not known how Saudi Arabia monitored private phone conversations that originated in the U.S. But in recent years, it has honed spy tactics old and new.Rights groups believe a citizen's snitching app developed by the Saudi government, and still available on Google Play, may have been used to report the tweets of al Madi and al Shehab.Investigations by the Citizen Lab research group, media organizations and Amnesty International alleged Saudi Arabia uses military-grade Israeli spyware. Amnesty said the spyware was installed on the phone of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee before Saudi officials killed him in 2018.Saudi documents and anecdotal accounts from Saudi exiles depict years of Saudi government employees and student informants tracking perceived subversion by students in the U.S.For Saudi exiles, \"it's a repression machine,\" said Khalid al Jabri, whose once highly placed family has been targeted by the crown prince. That includes siblings imprisoned by Prince Mohammed, and what the family charges was a Saudi assassination squad sent, unsuccessfully, to kill his father in Canada in 2018.\"They just want you to look over your shoulder. And that's what I do,\" said Danah al Mayouf, creator of a YouTube channel critical of Saudi officials.At least since 2017, the FBI said in a bulletin this year, Saudi government-supported \"Saudi agents and U.S.-based Saudi nationals, have monitored, harassed and threatened critics of the Saudi regime in the United States through both digital and in person means.\"Federal authorities under Biden have taken some steps regarding transnational repression. That includes stepped-up monitoring and a warning delivered to embassies in Washington. Federal prosecutors recently brought two of the first cases over Saudi spying and harassment of its nationals in the United States.A San Francisco federal jury in August convicted a former Twitter employee who prosecutors said was accessing private data of Twitter users, including critics of the Saudi government.A federal court in New York is wrapping up a case against a Saudi government-paid Saudi citizen living in Mississippi. Ibrahim al Hussayen sent Saudi dissidents in the U.S. messages via social media, including \"MBS will wipe you of the face of the earth\" and \"Do you think you are safe,\" according to federal authorities. Al Hussayen's lawyers notified the court last week he intends to plead guilty to lying to FBI agents. In an unusual move, the lawyers asked authorities to waive further investigation.Numerous Saudis in the U.S. in interviews describe meeting with FBI agents over fears or suspicions of being stalked. Four Saudis said the FBI informally advised them against going to Saudi Arabia or entering the Saudi Embassy. Two said FBI agents advised them they were on a Saudi list for retaliation. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.Saudi dissidents and advocates say the U.S. isn't doing enough to assure either exiles or Prince Mohammed that Washington will act when Saudi Arabia targets critics in the United States. They describe a life in the United States punctuated with suspicion-raising interactions with Saudi officials, strangers and acquaintances, abuse online, and fears of speaking openly on unencrypted apps. Khashoggi's killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul destroyed the long understood ground rules between Saudi rulers and ruled.\"It's targeting more people and, yeah, it's -- nothing happens,'' said Bethany al Haidari, a researcher with the Washington-based Freedom Initiative for Middle East political prisoners. \"You know, if you can get away with murder, what else?\" al Haidari asked.Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP)CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Daniel Sprong, Yanni Gourde and Matt Beniers scored in a five-minute span of the third period and the Seattle Kraken beat the Calgary Flames 5-4 on Tuesday night.Carson Soucy and Morgan Geekie also scored as the Kraken beat the Flames for the first time. Oliver Bjorkstrand had a pair of assists and Joey Daccord stopped 36 of 40 shots for the win in his first start of the season.\"We've got so much more confidence in this group,\" Gourde said. \"Last year was last year. We know we can rally back and we know we have the skills to do it.\"Tyler Toffoli had a goal and an assist for Calgary to reach 400 career points. Nazem Kadri, Nikita Zadorov and Trevor Lewis also scored for the Flames, who led 4-2 early in the third. Elias Lindholm added a pair of assists. Dan Vladar stopped 21 of 26 shots in the loss.\"We kept turning the puck over and eventually it was going to bite us,\" Toffoli said. \"That's what happened.\"Calgary was up 2-1 against Edmonton on Saturday but lost 3-2.\"We're not happy. We're an older group and we know good teams don't do that,\" Toffoli said.Calgary scored twice in a 17-second span starting at 1:34 of the third period for a 4-2 lead, but Seattle responded with power-play, short-handed and even-strength goals to pull ahead.\"Just finding timely plays and sticking with things, that's how you come out of these types of games with two points,\" Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said.Beniers scored on an odd-man rush off a feed from Jordan Eberle at 13:26. Gourde stripped Kadri of the puck in the neutral zone for a short-handed breakaway at 11:26. And with Calgary's Brett Ritchie serving an interference minor, Alex Wennberg at the side of the net fed Sprong for a one-timer at 8:31.\"A couple tough breaks that were kind of self-inflicted,\" Kadri said. \"Having a two-goal lead in the third period, you should be able to close it out, but give them credit. They pushed back.\"NOTES: Kadri, signed as a free agent in the offseason, has a team-leading 10 points (five goals, five assists) in eight games for Calgary. ... Ritchie's assist on Lewis' goal extended his point streak to four games (two goals, two assists). With three goals and three assists in eight games, Ritchie surpassed his point total from last season. ... Beniers extended his point streak to five games (four goals, one assist). ...

All Rights Reserved.North Korea keeps up missile barrage with ICBM      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea added to its barrage of recent weapons tests on Thursday, firing at least three missiles including an intercontinental ballistic missile that forced the Japanese government to issue evacuation alerts and temporarily halt trains. The launches are the latest in a series of North Korean weapons tests in recent months that have raised tensions in the region. They came a day after Pyongyang fired more than 20 missiles, the most it has fired in a single day ever. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North firing an ICBM from an area near its capital Pyongyang around 7:40 a.m.Analysis: North Korea fired dozens of missiles. What now?      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For days North Korean officials have raged over U.S.-South Korean military drills, promising a violent response. That response came this week, when the North fired more than 20 missiles -- one of which splashed down near the South Korean sea border. It was a significant escalation in a year that has already seen the most North Korean missile test launches ever, and it raises an important question: How much further will they go? North Korea's playbook has traditionally been to continually ratchet up provocations until it gets U.S. attention -- and can then negotiate for sanctions relief or other concessions from what it sees as a position of power.N Korea fires 23 missiles, prompting air raid alert in South      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded on a South Korean island and residents evacuated to underground shelters after North Korea fired more than 20 missiles Wednesday, at least one of them in its direction and landing near the rivals' tense sea border. South Korea quickly responded by launching its own missiles in the same border area. The launches came hours after North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons to get the U.S. and South Korea to \"pay the most horrible price in history\" in protest of ongoing South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. The White House maintained that the United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea and vowed to work with allies to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Australian police offer 633,000 reward for Indian suspect      CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australian police offered a 1 million Australian dollar (633,000) reward on Thursday for information on the whereabouts of an Indian national who is suspected of murdering a woman on a tropical beach four years ago before returning to his homeland. Queensland state police officers who speak Hindi and Punjabi are waiting in an office in Cairns to be contacted from India via WhatsApp or online about where Rajwinder Singh, 38, can be found, Detective Inspector Sonia Smith said. Singh was a nurse working at Innisfail, south of Cairns, when the body of 24-year-old Toyah Cordingley was found on Wangetti Beach on Monday, Oct.3 tragedies in Asia take hundreds of lives in 1 month      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- More than 400 people died in October in a series of crowd-related disasters in Asia, when a bridge packed with revelers collapsed in India, Halloween partiers were crushed in South Korea's capital, and spectators fled a stadium in Indonesia after police fired tear gas. The dynamics in the three situations were distinct, though experts say poor planning and crowd management contributed to the disasters in Indonesia and South Korea. In India, authorities are investigating whether the recently repaired bridge was properly inspected. ___ In Seoul, 156 people died when more than 100,000 flocked to the popular nightlife district of Itaewon on Saturday for Halloween celebrations, the first since the country's strict COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.Investigators raid Seoul police over deadly crowd surge      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's National Police Agency on Wednesday raided local police departments in the capital, Seoul, and the city's Yongsan district office as it investigates whether official ineptitude contributed to a deadly crowd surge that killed 156 people in the neighborhood of Itaewon. The raids came a day after the national agency acknowledged that Seoul police failed to act for hours despite receiving at least 11 emergency calls from pedestrians warning about a swelling crowd of Halloween revelers getting out of control ahead of the crush on Saturday in a narrow alley near Hamilton Hotel. The national agency said members of its special investigation unit were retrieving documents and other materials from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Yongsan's police station, district office and fire department and other offices.Families, friends struggle to cope after Seoul crush      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- As bereaved families and friends struggle to make sense of a Halloween crowd crush that killed 156 people in South Korea's capital, their grief is mixed with anger about officials' failure to employ crowd controls in a small nightlife district jammed with tens of thousands of partiers. Many expressed wrenching pain and deep frustration about what they saw as official ineptitude, including a failure by police to adequately respond to repeated emergency calls from people about the swelling crowd getting out of control hours before the crush occurred Saturday evening in a narrow alley near the Hamilton Hotel in the Itaewon entertainment district.Australia plays down US B-52 bomber plan that angers China      CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia's defense minister on Wednesday played down the significance of a major upgrade of B-52 facilities planned for northern Australia that has raised China's ire, saying the nuclear-capable U.S. bombers have been visiting since the 1980s. China this week condemned U.S. plans to deploy up to six of the long-range bombers at Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal in the Northern Territory, arguing the move undermined regional peace and stability. China also warned of a potential arms race in the region. Asked if the upgrade could prove too provocative, Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters, \"I think everyone needs to take a deep breath here.\" The multibillion-dollar U.S.Australian inquiry probes 40 years of gay hate killings      CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- A government inquiry began hearing evidence on Wednesday of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence. The Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales is the \"first of its kind anywhere in the world,\" a lawyer assisting the inquiry, Peter Gray, said at the hearing's outset in Sydney. The acronym in the title refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people. Responses from Australian society and its institutions including police to violent LGBTQ deaths had been \"sadly lacking,\" Gray said.Officials probe India bridge collapse as divers comb river      MORBI, India (AP) -- Scuba divers combed through a river in western India on Wednesday to make certain no bodies were left behind after the collapse of a newly repaired suspension bridge, as officials investigate what led to the tragedy that killed at least 135 people. The 143-year-old pedestrian bridge collapsed Sunday evening, sending hundreds plunging into the waters of the Machchu River in Gujarat state's Morbi town. As rescuers continue to search through the deep and muddy waters, questions have swirled over why the bridge collapsed and who might be responsible. The bridge, built during British colonialism and touted by the state's tourism website as an \"artistic and technological marvel,\" had reopened just four days earlier.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It is a good start for us as a group, which is way more important.\"Mattias Ekholm, Ryan Johansen, Filip Forsberg and Nino Niederreiter scored for the Predators (3-6-1), who have lost two in a row and seven of their last eight.\"The first period was kind of where we lost it,\" said Forsberg, who was asked about the play of McDavid and Draisaitl. \"They're two of the top players in this league and I think we gave them a little too much room, especially at the start.\"When we give these guys time, they're going to take advantage of it and it was a little too easy for them at times. You can't give anyone in this league too much time, but especially not those guys.\"Nashville scored just 34 seconds into the game, as a pass deflected off a skate and on net for a stick save, but the rebound went straight to Ekholm for the easy goal.Edmonton rebounded with three goals in just over seven minutes.

(AP Photo/Matt York)The Minnesota Timberwolves bench watches during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Phoenix Suns, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Matt York)PHOENIX (AP) -- Cam Johnson scored 29 points, making seven 3-pointers, and the Phoenix Suns beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 on Tuesday night for their fifth straight victory. Johnson finished 7 of 11 behind the arc and 10 for 17 overall in another strong outing for the former reserve who is now in the starting lineup.\"I think he is getting more comfortable with the role, but defensively he was really good,\" Suns coach Monty Williams said.The victory was the fifth straight for the Suns (6-1), who won without center Deandre Ayton, sidelined with a sprained right ankle.Johnson helped pick up his team with Devin Booker having a tough night shooting. Booker still had 18 points but was 2 of 7 from 3-point range and 6 of 18 overall. He did have seven rebounds and five assists.\"Offensively he was really aggressive,\" Williams said of Johnson. \"Everybody was telling him to shoot the ball. He is more than a shooter. He has the ability to make plays. He is a really good passer.\" Johnson also had the responsibility of guarding Karl-Anthony Towns. \"That is a challenge I really enjoy,\" Johnson said. \"They play a little bit different, so being able to execute what we worked on feels pretty good.\"Minnesota got within 87-85 after Anthony Edwards hit a 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter. But the Timberwolves committed six turnovers in their next seven possessions and the Suns were never threatened after that.\"Carelessness, bad spacing, poor execution, certainly some heightened defense by Phoenix. But we've got to be better in those moments,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. \"Whatever the defense is giving us, we've got to take that.\"Mikal Bridges had 19 points for Phoenix and Chris Paul had 15 points, 12 assists and a team-high eight rebounds for the Suns, who led by as many as 18 points.Towns and Edwards scored 24 points apiece. Towns had 10 rebounds and seven assists, while Edwards made five 3-pointers in 10 attempts.Naz Reid scored 13 points, making 5 of 6 shots, and fellow reserve Jaylen Nowell scored 10 for Minnesota.Despite the absence of Ayton, the Suns held their own on the boards against the taller Timberwolves, with Minnesota outrebounding Phoenix 42-34. The Wolves entered the night third in the NBA in rebounding with 49 per game.Rudy Gobert had nine rebounds for Minnesota and scored seven points, all from the free throw line. He took just one shot from the field in 32 minutes. Two other Wolves starters didn't contribute much -- D'Angelo Russell had five points and Jaden McDaniels, limited to 17 minutes by foul trouble, scored four.Suns guard Ish Wainright's father died Monday. Calvin Wainright, who was 68, was a longtime basketball coach and mentor in Kansas City. Ish Wainright has been out with a back injury since the beginning of the season, and away from the team in recent days.\"They all were taken aback by it, they have supported him the way they always do,\" coach Monty Williams said of his players hearing the news.Williams said he felt bad for Suns great Steve Nash, who is no longer the coach of the Brooklyn Nets after a tumultuous tenure.\"It's always tough. We all kind of know how hard these jobs can be,\" Williams said. \"I haven't seen anybody have to deal with more than him in recent years as far as non-basketball stuff. It's tough to watch from afar.\"Timberwolves: G Jordan McLaughlin (right heel) played after missing two games. He finished with nine points.Suns: F Torrey Craig returned from a left heel injury for Phoenix. C Dario Saric played his second game of the season. He missed the entire 2021-22 season after tearing his ACL in the 2021 NBA Finals.

(AP Photo/Gary McCullough, File)The NCAA is allowing teams to play and practice on Election Day after making it a mandatory off day the past two years to allow athletes to participate in civic engagement.The move came on the recommendation of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, which called for allowing athletes who are in season to have activities on Election Day if they are provided another day off in the 15 days before or after that date for civic engagement opportunities. \"We had these discussions to give athletes the most flexibility as possible,\" said Wake Forest basketball player Olivia Summiel, who is on the SAAC. \"Civic engagement isn't just going to vote. It's getting involved in your community. Definitely laying out different ways of what can we do to fulfill this. It leaves teams flexibility to fill that void.\"The amended rule was passed in June. Many athletes use absentee ballots.There are 11 men's basketball games next Tuesday, including No. 8 UCLA hosting Sacramento State. There are also 10 women's games, including a marquee matchup of No. 5 Tennessee visiting No. 14 Ohio State.\"Much of it had to do with availability here and what worked for both us and Tennessee,\" Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. \"Ours is a later game (8:30 p.m. tip) so it gives people plenty of time to do their civic duty and vote.\"The first day for teams to officially start playing games is Monday. No. 11 Indiana is also playing on Tuesday because the men's team is playing on Monday and the school doesn't do doubleheaders with the two teams. The Hoosiers used Oct. 27 as their civic engagement day.Wake Forest is playing on Monday. Summiel said her team had a variety of civic engagement activities planned over the next week.\"We are discussing participating in a march to the polls event,\" Summiel said. \"The team will march from our athletic facilities to the church across the street where they hold registration to vote. We want to take it on as a team and gather people within campus on our way there to get people registered there.\"Summiel also said the athletic department is having a speaker that night on campus for all the teams.While there are nearly two dozen college basketball games next Tuesday, the NBA is taking the night off after every team plays the night before. The NBA is hoping teams use that night as an opportunity to encourage fans to get out and vote, plus amplify the need for civic engagement. There are 11 NHL games on election night, including three in Canada. There are also three college football games being played that night.AP women's college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya, seated, speaks with Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, just before Nebenzya addressed the Security Council during a session to discuss the situation with grain shipments from Ukraine at United Nations headquarters, Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected Russia's attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out \"military biological\" activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons.Russia only got support from China in the vote on its resolution, with the U.S., Britain and France voting \"no\" and the 10 other council nations abstaining. The resolution was not approved because it failed to get the minimum nine \"yes\" votes required for adoption. The 2-3-10 vote reflected the council's continuing opposition and skepticism about Russia's actions since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The council has been paralyzed from taking any action against Russia's military offensive because of Russia's veto power.Russia circulated the draft resolution and a 310-page document to council members last week alleging that military biological activity is taking place at biological laboratories in Ukraine with support from the U.S. Defense Department.Russia's deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said after the vote that his government was \"extremely disappointed\" that the council did not respond positively to its request to establish a commission. Its proposed resolution called for the Security Council's 15 members to carry out the investigation of Russia's complaint, as allowed under Article VI of the biological weapons convention, and present a report with recommendations to the council by Nov. 30.Polyansky claimed \"Western countries demonstrated in every way that the law does not apply to them\" and \"are ready to trample any norm, to flout any rule,\" accusing them of a \"colonial mentality.\"U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield countered that the United States voted against the resolution \"because it is based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith, and a total lack of respect for this body.\"Before the vote, Russia's Polyansky called the resolution \"a considerable milestone\" that would show whether the Security Council was prepared to act in line with international law giving state parties to the biological weapons convention the right to seek an investigation at the Security Council.\"It is a milestone for Russia's deception and lies,\" Thomas-Greenfield shot back. \"And the world sees it.\"At a meeting in September of the 197 state parties to the biological weapons convention, she said, \"Russia failed to provide any credible evidence to support these false allegations\" and an overwhelming number of countries that spoke \"considered that the issues raised by Russia were unsubstantiated and had been conclusively addressed.\" But Thomas-Greenfield said that wasn't enough for Russia and \"it inappropriately raised the same false claims here, abusing its position and abusing us.\" Mexico's deputy ambassador Juan Manuel Gomez Robledo, whose country abstained, said Russia didn't provide evidence to activate an investigation. He said it was not \"realistic\" to set up a commission to report in 28 days -- and a commission could not be independent and objective if Russia as a council member was included so it would have to be excluded \"since it is one of the parties involved in the armed conflict.\" Russia's initial allegation of secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine in March has been disputed by independent scientists, Ukrainian leaders and officials at the White House and Pentagon. An Associated Press investigation in March found the claim was taking root online, uniting COVID-19 conspiracy theorists, QAnon adherents and some supporters of former President Donald Trump.Ukraine does have a network of biological labs that have gotten funding and research support from the U.S. They are owned and operated by Ukraine and are part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manmade. The U.S. efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union's program for weapons of mass destruction.Russia called a Security Council meeting on its claims last Thursday, which the United States and its Western allies vehemently dismissed.Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, called the meeting \"a colossal waste of time\" and said the claims are part of a Moscow \"disinformation campaign\" that is attempting \"to distract from the atrocities Russian forces are carrying out in Ukraine and a desperate tactic to justify an unjustifiable war.\"\"Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program,\" she said. \"The United States does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States.\"Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the U.S. of conducting work in Ukraine with deadly pathogens -- including cholera, plague, anthrax and influenza -- that couldn't be justified under the guise of public health. He said documents and evidence recovered by Russian authorities suggested a military application.Nebenzia told the Security Council that the Russian military during its time in Ukraine had recovered drones capable of spraying bioagents as well as documents that he said related to research on the possibility of spreading pathogens through bats and migrating birds.Thomas-Greenfield countered that Russia's claims are \"absurd for many reasons, including because such species, even if they could be weaponized, would pose as much a threat to the European continent and to Ukraine itself as they would to any other country.\"Russia's Polyansky told the council Wednesday that regardless of the vote, \"the questions to the United States and Ukraine is something that we do retain and the evidence accompanying our complaint still requires clarifications.\"He said Russia will continue to make efforts to establish the facts through the biological weapons convention and any violators will still have to be held accountable by the international community.Associated Press writer David Klepper contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Nick Ritchie scored a tiebreaking goal midway through the third period and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Florida Panthers 3-1 on Tuesday night for their first victory in three games at their new Mullett Arena home.\"It was pretty cool,\" Ritchie said. \"The crowd was standing for us the last minute of the game. It was loud in here for a small barn. It feels good. We want to do more of that at home.\"Ritchie's power-play goal with 11:05 remaining came on a wrist shot from the slot that beat Spencer Knight to the glove side for a 2-1 lead. Ritchie has four goals this season, all on the power play.Florida pulled Knight with two minutes remaining and Clayton Keller scored into an empty net with 1:07 left.Lawson Crouse also scored on a power play for Arizona, which had lost four of five. The Coyotes have converted 11 of 34 power-play opportunities, which ranks among the NHL leaders, after going 2 for 4 in this one. \"When we play with urgency defensively, we are a tough team to beat,\" Arizona coach Andre Tourigny said. \"We're honest. Goalie stopped 41 pucks, our (penalty kill) shut down a team like Florida and your power play scored two goals. That's a good recipe. I hope we can copy and paste a few times.\"Karel Vejmelka made 41 saves for Arizona.\"It was a good win against one of the best teams in the league,\" said Vejmelka, who was under constant pressure in the final minutes. The Coyotes did not convert on their two first-period power-play chances but made good on their final two.\"We didn't make any adjustment,\" Tourigny said. \"Power play is a matter of execution. The pass has to be on the tape. The pass has to be quick. We need to be crisp. We went into the third and we zipped the puck and scored a big goal.\"Colin White scored to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead in the second period in the opener of their four-game, five-day trip out West. The Panthers had won three in a row and were 7-1-1 in their last nine games against Arizona. Knight made 18 saves while losing for the first time in four starts this season. \"The third period is where we lost the game,\" Florida coach Paul Maurice said. \"We had done what we needed to do and didn't accept through 40 minutes that it was still a tight game, and the first 10 minutes (of the third period) we did a lot of things we hadn't done this year, uncharacteristic play.\"Florida hit two posts and Vejmelka stopped Patric Hornqvist on a breakaway in the first three minutes of the second before White broke through, tipping in a high shot from right in front over Vejmelka's left shoulder at 8:24. White has a point in all six road games for Florida, tying a franchise record to open the season.Crouse tied it five minutes later on a power play with a wrist shot from the slot. The Coyotes will spend this season and the next two on the Arizona State University campus at Mullett Arena, capacity 5,000, after the city of Glendale refused to renew their lease at Gila River Arena.Florida G Sergei Bobrovsky is two games short of 600. ... The Panthers mustered seven shots in the first period but finished with 42. They had 51 shots and a franchise-record 58 in their previous two games, respectively.Coyotes F Nick Schmaltz (upper body) missed his eighth straight game and Conor Timmins (upper body) missed his seventh. Arizona D Jakob Chychrun (wrist) has not played this season while recovering from offseason surgery. F Zack Kassian (lower body) is day-to-day. ...

(Nov. 3) (AP Video by Tatiana Pollastri, Juan Pablo Arraez, Victor Caivano, Andre Penner and Mario Lobao)RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- In the run-up to Brazil's presidential election, many feared a narrow result would be contested and spell the death knell for Latin America's largest democracy.So far, however, the worst fears have been averted, despite a nail-biting victory for former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, and ongoing protests by some of Bolsonaro's supporters across the country.The conservative leader's allies quickly recognized da Silva's victory, the military stayed in the barracks and vigilant world leaders swooped in to offer support for da Silva and nip in the bud even the thought of anything resembling the Jan. 6 insurrection that overtook the U.S. Capitol.\"All of Bolsonaro's escape valves were shut off,\" said Brian Winter, a longtime Brazil expert and vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"He was prevailed upon from all sides not to contest the results and burn down the house on his way out.\"Although Bolsonaro has refused to congratulate da Silva, Brazil's institutions generally seem to have held up.Bolsonaro gave a video statement Wednesday calling for an end to the protests by his supporters. \"I know you're upset. I'm just as sad and upset as you are. But we have to keep our heads straight,\" he said. \"Closing roads in Brazil jeopardizes people's right to come and go.\"That leaves a more vexing challenge: how the 77-year-old da Silva, universally known as Lula, unites a deeply divided country, rights a wobbly economy and delivers on the outsize expectations spurred by his return to power.One thing is clear, if anyone can do it, it's the charismatic da Silva -- whose political skills are admired even by his detractors.\"That's what we need, someone not only who can address inequality but also inspire our emotions and ideas,\" said Marcelo Neri, director of the Getulio Vargas Foundation's social policy center and a former Strategic Affairs Minister for da Silva's handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff. In many ways, the conservative movement Bolsonaro helped ignite -- if not the politician himself -- has emerged stronger from the vote, Winter said. His allies were elected as governors in several key states and his Liberal Party has become the largest in Congress, curtailing da Silva's ability to advance his own agenda after a decadelong malaise that has left millions of Brazilians hungrier than when da Silva last held office in 2010.What's more, Brazil's demographics seem to favor Bolsonaro's aggressive brand of identity politics -- including an anti-LGBTQ agenda and hostility to environmentalists -- that have earned him the moniker the \"Trump of the Tropics.\"The country's own statistics institute forecasts that the number of Brazilians identifying as evangelical Christians -- who preelection polls show overwhelmingly favored Bolsonaro and skew right -- will overtake Roman Catholics within a decade.Thousands of Bolsonaro's supporters thronged a regional army headquarters in Rio on Wednesday, demanding that the military step in and keep him in power. Others showed up at military installations in Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina and the capital of Brasilia. Meanwhile, truckers maintained about 150 roadblocks across the country to protest Bolsonaro's loss, despite the Supreme Court's orders to law enforcement to dismantle them. At one of the road blockades held by truck drivers in the interior of Sao Paulo state, a car drove into the crowd and injured several, including children and members of the police. Since the return of democracy in the 1980s, all Brazilian leaders have been guided to varying degrees by a common belief in strong state-led enterprises, high taxes and aggressive wealth redistribution policies.Bolsonaro initially attempted to run a more austere, business-friendly government, that is, until the social devastation wreaked by COVID-19 and his own sinking electoral prospects ultimately led him to loosen spending controls and emulate the policies he once attacked.How da Silva will govern is less clear. He squeaked out a narrow victory of barely 2 million votes after building a broad coalition united by little more than a desire to defeat Bolsonaro. And with promises to maintain a generous welfare program in place through 2023, he will have limited fiscal space to spend on other priorities.His running mate from another party, former Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckim, was a nod to centrist, fiscally conservative policies that made da Silva the darling of Wall Street during his early years in power. This week, da Silva tapped Alckim to lead his transition team.Also standing alongside him on the victory stage Sunday night, however, were several stalwarts of the left who have been implicated in numerous corruption scandals that have plagued his Workers' Party and paved the way for Bolsonaro's rise.Although da Silva's supporters have downplayed the concerns about corruption -- the Supreme Court annulled the convictions that kept him imprisoned for nearly two years -- for many Brazilians he is a symbol of the culture of graft that has long permeated politics. As a result, he's likely to be held to a higher ethical standard in a country where almost every government has been accused of vote buying in Congress.\"This wasn't just a fever dream by his opponents,\" Winter said of the corruption allegations that have long dogged da Silva's party.Da Silva's victory coincides with a string of recent victories by the left in South America, including in Chile and Colombia, whose leaders revere the former union boss. During his first stint in power, da Silva led a so-called pink wave that promoted regional integration, rivaled U.S. dominance and put the rights of overlooked minorities and Indigenous groups at the center of the political agenda.Under Bolsonaro, Brazil largely retreated from that leadership role, even if the sheer size of its economy alone means a return to leadership is never far off.Scott Hamilton, a former U.S. diplomat, said that da Silva will have to make a tough choice on whether to use Brazil's considerable leverage to pursue an ambitious foreign policy to tackle entrenched problems or simply use his star power on the world stage to shore up support at home.\"Basking in not being Bolsonaro will get him lots of positive attention in itself,\" said Hamilton, whose last post, until April, was as consul general in Rio. \"The more ambitious path would involve trying to help resolve some of the toughest political issues where democratic governments in the region are in trouble or extinguished.\"Goodman reported from Miami.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP)VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Yegor Sharangovich and Jack Hughes each scored and had an assist to help the New Jersey Devils beat the Vancouver Canucks 5-2 on Tuesday night.Nico Hischier, Michael McLeod and Dawson Mercer also had goals for the Devils (7-3-0), who won their fourth game in a row for the first time since October 2018.Bo Horvat replied for the Canucks (2-6-2) with a pair of power-play goals. J.T. Miller assisted on both.New Jersey netminder Mackenzie Blackwood made 21 saves and improved his career record against Vancouver to 5-0-0.\"I think we've been doing a good job of capitalizing on our chances as of late and really limiting stuff that the other team was getting in our end,\" Blackwood said. \"Tonight we did a good job of burying chances.\"Jesper Bratt had an assist on Hischier's fifth goal, extending his season-opening point streak to 10 games (four goals, 12 assists), which equaled a franchise record.\"I think (Bratt's) playing a team game and he's getting rewarded,\" Devils coach Lindy Ruff said.\"He's taking advantage of the opportunities and he's finding a way every night to get on the board.\"Thatcher Demko stopped 32 of 36 shots for Vancouver.The defeat snapped a two-game win streak for the Canucks, who lost seven in a row to start the season.\"We need our veteran guys and our better players to be better players consistently, every day, not just one good game here and one good game there,\" Vancouver coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"And that goes not only for (defensemen) but it goes for the forwards as well and the goaltending as well.\"Boudreau pulled his goalie with less than two minutes left and Hughes scored into the empty net.Vancouver made a late push, pulling Demko in favor of an extra attacker after New Jersey's Ryan Graves was called for holding with 3:34 left on the clock.The move paid off when Horvat buried his second of the night with a one-timer from the high hash marks at the 17:12 mark, cutting the deficit to 4-2.\"Obviously, the puck's going in right now. But I'd rather be getting wins than scoring goals right now. I'd rather have none and be 9-0-0,\" Horvat said. \"But it's not the way it's going right now. And we've got to put this one in the past and keep plugging away here.\"Canucks defenseman Ethan Bear and center Jack Studnicka made their debuts for Vancouver after being acquired in separate trades last week. Star blueliner Quinn Hughes returned to the lineup after missing four games with a lower-body injury.The Canucks wore their new navy blue \"Johnny Canuck\" reverse retro jerseys. The sweaters pay homage to the team's namesake, a lumberjack-looking character called Johnny Canuck, which served as the team's logo when it entered the Western Hockey League in 1945.New Jersey: At the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday.Vancouver: Hosts the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday.AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Chinese regulators downplayed China's real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday. (AP Photo/Bertha Wang)HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese regulators downplayed China's real estate slump and slowing economic growth while Hong Kong's top leader pitched Hong Kong as a unique link to the rest of China at a high-profile investment summit Wednesday.About 200 global financial executives gathered to network and discuss issues such as global risks and sustainable finance at Hong Kong's first major conference since the city lifted COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to \"bet against\" China and Hong Kong.International media \"don't really understand China very well\" and have a \"short-term focus,\" he said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Fang and other Chinese officials addressed the conference in prerecorded interviews -- travel to and from mainland China is constrained by strict quarantine requirements.China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said that inflation remains subdued, at under 3 compared with 8 or more in many Western economies, and the country's economic and reform policies will continue. Such comments appeared to be meant to counter worries that flared following a Communist Party congress last month, where leader Xi Jinping was awarded an unprecedented third five-year term and key reformers were excluded from top ruling party leadership. \"China has a super large market, as there is still much room for urbanization and the demand of middle class consumers is still on the rise,\" said Yi.China's economy grew at a 3.9 annual pace in the last quarter compared to a year earlier, well below an official target of more than 5, and the vital real estate sector has languished as regulators have sought to curb debt mounting toward unsustainable levels. Xiao Yuanqi, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, sought to reassure those attending the conference, saying property loans make up just 26 banks' total lending and 90 of property loans were \"good quality.\"Shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai surged Wednesday, with the Hang Seng gaining 2.4 while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.2. The speakers lineup at the Hong Kong conference includes Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and other leading executives from institutions such as Citigroup and Blackstone.It is designed to highlight the former British colony's role as an attractive and competitive financial hub.The city remains the \"only place in the world where the global advantage and the China advantage come together in a single city,\" Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said in opening the event.\"This unique convergence makes Hong Kong the irreplaceable connection between the mainland and the rest of the world as the center of economic gravity in the world shifts eastward,\" he said.The British handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the understanding that Beijing would allow the tiny territory autonomy in its legal system and economic policies for at least 50 years. In recent years Beijing has been expanding its influence. Such efforts gained momentum after mass protests in 2019 demanding a more democratic system of leadership, culminating in the implementation of a security law designed to quash dissent. Combined with strict quarantine controls and a sharp downturn in tourism, that has compounded the economic impact from the pandemic. Lee said the \"worst is behind\" Hong Kong. A former security chief, he told the conference \"law and order has returned\" and social disturbances were in the past.Organizers pushed ahead with the long-planned conference despite tropical storm warnings that led authorities to close schools. As tropical storm Nalgae drew closer to the city, the Hong Kong Observatory said that it would raise its T8 signal in the afternoon, which would effectively shut down the city and stop trading on the stock market. Hong Kong pulled out all the stops for the financial conference, adjusting COVID-19 restrictions to allow participants to dine in at specific restaurants. Most other inbound travelers are banned from doing so for three days after they arrive in the city. Attendees who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave by chartered flights if they want to, instead of having to be isolated for at least seven days in Hong Kong.Some U.S. lawmakers have urged American companies not to participate in the meeting given tensions with China over trade and human rights. The U.S. has been vocal about Hong Kong's crackdown on dissent following implementation of the National Security Law.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Trevor Zegras and Troy Terry scored shootout goals and the Anaheim Ducks overcame Erik Karlsson's first career hat trick to beat the San Jose Sharks 6-5 on Tuesday night.Logan Couture scored for San Jose in the shootout but Anthony Stolarz stopped Karlsson and Kevin Labanc to earn his first win of the year.\"As a goalie, you can't worry about the number of goals that you give up during the game,\" Stolarz said. \"You've just got to focus on that next shot. Obviously tonight the guys did a great job putting the puck in the net and it was kind of just up to me to make that big save when I needed to.\"Stolarz finished with 39 saves to improve to 6-1 against the Sharks in his career.\"I just like this building,\" he joked. \"You play enough games here, it becomes natural. It must be the lighting or something.\"Adam Henrique scored twice for Anaheim. Ryan Strome, Frank Vatrano and Max Comtois also scored as the Ducks won their first road game of the year, improving to 1-5-1.\"I think it was probably a very entertaining game for the fans and maybe not so much for both teams when it comes to the structure part of it,\" Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said.Karlsson had three goals and an assist for San Jose. Timo Meier added two goals.\"The puck went in, which is all that matters,\" Karlsson said. \"It's nice (for the team) to score five goals, but at the same time we let in five as well.\"Kahkonen stopped 39 shots.Henrique opened the scoring 5:16 into the first period with his first goal of the year. Karlsson answered with two goals in 23 seconds, the seventh-fastest mark by a single player in Sharks history.\"I think everybody is seeing what a world class player he is,\" San Jose coach David Quinn praised. \"We're talking about a two-time Norris Trophy winner and he's only 32 years old. He's got a lot of great hockey ahead of him and he's certainly playing like a Norris Trophy winner now.\"Vatrano tied it later in the first and Henrique put Anaheim back ahead with 15 seconds left in the period. Meier responded with a power play goal early in the second to tie the game at 3.Strome gave the Ducks the lead later in the period, but Meier was credited with the tying goal just 21 seconds later when Anaheim's Jakob Silfverberg accidentally shot the puck into his own net.Comtois scored the go-ahead goal 11:31 into the third period, but Karlsson tied it with 2:12 left and the goalie pulled for an extra skater.\"It was an up-and-down game,\" Eakins said. \"There was a ton of emotion in the game, a ton of emotion on our bench. When you can bend and not break, and when you can learn to channel your emotions in the right direction, I think it's a great learning experience.\"Karlsson's hat trick was the first by a defenseman in Sharks history. He leads NHL defensemen with nine goals and 15 points. ... Quinn remained at 99 career victories as San Jose fell to 1-6 at home. ...

(AP Photo/Michael Woods, File)Detroit Mercy guard Antoine Davis has a chance to end his career as one of the most prolific scorers and 3-point shooters in college basketball history.Davis is more concerned with earning the NCAA Tournament berth that has eluded him thus far.The 6-foot-1 Davis entered the transfer portal during the offseason but opted to play one more season for his father. Mike Davis took over Detroit Mercy after reaching the NCAA Tournament four of his six seasons at Texas State, but he still hasn't earned a bid at his current school.\"I experienced it for myself as a spectator but not as a player,\" Antoine Davis said as he recalled those years watching his father coach Texas State. \"It's been rough, but I look forward to this season. We're all on the same page. Everybody wants to do the same thing. I think we can make it happen.\"Reaching the NCAA Tournament is just about the only thing Antoine Davis has failed to accomplish in his stellar college career. He enters the 2022-23 season as one of the most noteworthy players from mid-major or low-major programs.Davis has scored 2,734 career points to rank 22nd in Division I history. He was the third-leading Division I scorer last season with 23.9 points per game, and that was actually the lowest average of his career. Davis averaged 26.1 points in 2018-19, 24.3 in 2019-20 and 24.0 in 2020-21.If Davis matches his output from last season, when he scored 694 points, he would end his career second on the all-time list. Pete Maravich owns the record with the 3,667 points he scored in his three-season career at LSU from 1967-70.His 429 career 3-pointers put him just 80 away from the Division I record. Fletcher Magee made 509 3-pointers at Wofford from 2015-19.Davis has scored in double figures in 111 consecutive games. The Division I record of 115 is shared by Campbell's Chris Clemons (2016-19) and La Salle's Lionel Simmons (1987-90).The extra season of eligibility Davis received due to the pandemic has helped him approach those records. It also gives him an opportunity to become a five-time, first-team all-Horizon League selection. Davis already is the first player ever to earn first-team all-Horizon League honors in four separate seasons.Davis committed to Houston in high school but changed his mind and opted for Texas State to play for his father, who owns a 397-310 career record and coached Indiana to an NCAA Tournament final in 2002. When his dad took the Detroit Mercy job, Davis ended up enrolling there instead.\"He knows my game better than anybody else,\" Davis said. \"He's been working me out for years and years. He just knows what I can do and everything. It wouldn't have to be anything different. I knew his system for the most part, and I really wanted to play for him, at the end of the day.\"He thought about leaving Detroit Mercy and the Horizon League this year. Davis entered the transfer portal and strongly considered BYU and Kansas State before choosing to finish his college career where he started it.\"It would feel a little off playing somewhere else or ending my career somewhere else,\" Davis said. \"That's what ultimately made me come back.\"Some other players from mid-major or low-major programs who bear watching:Abmas burst onto the scene in 2021 when he averaged 26.7 points in three NCAA Tournament games to help Oral Roberts beat Ohio State and Florida before falling to Arkansas in the Sweet 16. He led Division I with 24.5 points per game that season. Abmas followed that up by averaging 22.8 points last season to rank fifth. His 3.8 3-pointers per game ranked third.Carry, a Duquesne transfer, was the Mid-American Conference's player of the year in his first season at Kent State. The 6-1 guard ranked second in the MAC in assists (4.8) and fifth in scoring (17.9) and made the MAC's all-defensive team.The Oregon transfer was the Colonial Athletic Association player of the year last season in his first year at Hofstra. Estrada led the CAA in scoring (18.5) and assists (5.0) and also had 5.7 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game.Although he's a 6-foot-8 forward, Evbuomwan actually led the Ivy League in assists last season with 5.1 per game. He was named the Ivy player of the year. Evbuomwan, who is from Newcastle, England, also ranked fourth in the league in scoring (16.0), rebounding (6.7) and steals (1.4). DARIUS McGHEE, LIBERTYMcGhee has been named ASUN player of the year each of the last two seasons. He averaged 24.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 2021-22. He led all Division I players with 142 3-pointers and ranked second in points per game. After starting his career at Seton Hall and playing two seasons at Tulane, Walker has found a home at UAB. Walker ranked eighth in Division I in 3-pointers per game (3.41) and 16th in points per game (20.3) last season while leading Conference USA in both categories.

Ben McCollum was not a popular pick when Northwest Missouri State hired him to lead its men's basketball program 14 years ago. He was 27 and had never been a head coach. Now, his Bearcats are coming off a third straight Division II national championship and their fourth in the last five NCAA Tournaments. (Denny Simmons/Evansville Courier  Press via AP, File)MARYVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- Ben McCollum was not a popular pick when Northwest Missouri State hired him to lead its men's basketball team 14 years ago. He was 27 years old and had never been a head coach, and he was being asked to take over a Division II program that had a proud and winning reputation.The pride is still there. The winning? Well, these days the Bearcats almost never lose.They are coming off a record third straight national title and their fourth in the last five NCAA tournaments, and they lost just one player from the team that cut down the nets again in March. That one was Trevor Hudgins, who became the first Northwest Missouri State player in the NBA when he signed with the Houston Rockets over the summer.Not surprisingly, McCollum's phone has been alive the past few years as Division I administrators gauge his interest in moving to college basketball's highest level. And while that time may come, McCollum is clear that it would take the perfect opportunity to pry him away from the dynasty he's built in the small northwest Missouri town of Maryville.\"I'm not the type that's self-promoting. It's just not what I do,\" McCollum explained. \"I'm not constantly out there searching for the next place to go. If that place comes to find me and it's a match, that's probably how it will end up happening. If I do leave at some point. But the right fit is probably a bigger version of what we have here.\"Good luck finding a bigger program that wins as much as the Bearcats.They rose to prominence in the 1980s and '90s under Steve Tappmeyer, winning seven conference championships with 10 trips to the NCAA Tournament. But not even Tappmeyer could get the Bearcats to the Elite Eight until a gritty overachiever from Iowa transferred in from a junior college to lead the way.It was the first time that McCollum led them to new heights.The second came after a couple of years as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, then five years as an assistant at conference-rival Emporia State. Tappmeyer stepped away in 2009 and Northwest Missouri State turned to the energetic former player to take over, a questionable decision made even more unpopular by two straight losing seasons.The turnaround came in 2012, when McCollum led the Bearcats to a 22-7 record, won the conference title and reached the first round of the NCAA Tournament. They reached the Sweet 16 two years later, went 35-1 and won their first national title in 2017, then went 38-0 and won their second championship two years later. And after COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the 2020 tournament -- the Bearcats were 31-1 at the time -- they proceeded to win two more titles.All told, they've won 17 consecutive NCAA Tournament games and 24 of their past 25, and the only schools to win more Division II national championships are Kentucky Wesleyan with eight and Evansville, now in Division I, with five.\"I don't think people understand the difficulty of handling success vs. handling adversity,\" said McCollum, who's won a record five NABC coach of the year awards at his level. \"It's excruciatingly difficult to take in the amount of love these guys get for winning a title and come back with humility and do it again.\"It helps that there is continuity within the program. Xavier Kurth was one of the stars of McCollum's first title team and became an assistant coach. Hudgins redshirted as a freshman and played four seasons at Northwest Missouri State. Others have had chances to transfer to Division I schools but have remained loyal to the Bearcats.\"They turned me into the player I am today,\" Hudgins said. \"All the records I broke and everything else, it's all coach and the players I played with -- just how we played, how well we were coached. It made a huge impact on me.\"The Bearcats win despite being in a talent-lean area of the country, though most of their players still come from a relatively small geographic area. And that speaks volumes of the ability of McCollum and his staff to identify underappreciated talent like Hudgins, who received no Division I offers despite growing up in the same town as Kansas State.On the floor, the Bearcats run perhaps the most efficient offense in college basketball. It's predicated on angles and screens and spacing to get open looks, but there are no discernable patterns. It is a nightmare to defend.\"We just get the right players, and I mean, the coaching staff is a big part of it,\" said forward Wes Dreamer, who grew up not far from the University of Nebraska. \"Then it comes down to effort in the end, and what Coach Mac is telling us to do.\"There are plenty of examples of Division I schools plucking head coaches from the lower rungs of the sport.Missouri hired Kim Anderson, fresh off a national title at Central Missouri, to lead its program, though he was fired after just three years. Indiana State recently hired Lincoln coach Josh Shertz, who had taken the Railsplitters to three Final Fours since 2016. And Mount St. Mary's hired Dan Engelstead in 2018 from Southern Vermont, a Division III program, and two years ago he took the Mountaineers to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history.Those three coaches had been Division I assistants, though. McCollum has never worked at that level. So if he does leave Northwest Missouri State, it will probably take an athletic director willing to take a calculated risk, and a considerable leap of faith, in hiring McCollum to lead a program at college basketball's highest level.Just like administrators did at Northwest Missouri State more than a decade ago.AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Shanghai, Seoul and Sydney also followed Wall Street lower after the Fed on Wednesday raised its key rate to the highest level in 15 years.Oil prices declined while the euro stayed below 99 cents.Wall Street's benchmark SP 500 index plunged 2.5 after the Fed raised its short-term lending rate by 0.75 percentage points, three times its usual margin, for a fourth time this year.Fed Chair Jerome Powell reinforced expectations of more rate hikes, saying \"we have a ways to go.\" He said it would be \"very premature\" to consider pausing.\"Recession risks are rising, but that is the price the Fed is prepared to pay to get inflation under control,\" said James Knightley, Padhraic Garvey and Chris Turner of ING in a report.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 488 points to 15,338.85 and Sydney's SP-ASX 200 fell 1.9 to 6,855.40. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 to 2,997.46. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.6 to 2,322.11. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also fell.The Fed and central banks in Europe and Asia have raised rates aggressively this year to stop inflation that is running at multi-decade highs. Investors worry that might tip the global economy into recession.Consumer prices in the United States rose 6.2 over a year earlier in September, the same as the previous month. But core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices to give a clearer picture of the trend, accelerated to 5.1 from August's 4.9.The Fed said Wednesday it could shift to a more deliberate pace of rate hikes and would consider the overall economic impact.On Wall Street, the SP 500 fell to 3,759.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5 to 32,147.76. The Nasdaq composite slid 3.4 to 10,524.80. Tech stocks, retailers and health care companies were among the biggest declines.Apple, Inc. fell 3.7, Amazon.com, Inc. dropped 4.8 and Johnson  Johnson, Inc. slipped 1.5.The yield on the two-year Treasury, an indicator of market expectations of Fed action, rose to 4.58 from 4.55 before the Fed statement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, used to set mortgage rates, climbed to 4.10 from 3.98.Investors hope signs housing sales and other activity are weakening might encourage Fed officials to ease rate hike plans. But the latest data, especially on hiring, are relatively strong, a sign the Fed might stay aggressive.Data from payroll processor ADP showed companies added jobs at a faster pace in October than expected.The government is due to release unemployment data Thursday and a report on the broader jobs market on Friday.In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 43 cents to 89.57 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 1.63 to 90 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, shed 27 cents to 95.89 per barrel in London.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady yells on the line of scrimmage during the second half of an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022, in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Jason Behnken)Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey had milestone weekends.The two star running backs had memorable games on Sunday with Henry rushing for 219 yards and two TDs against Houston and McCaffrey having a rare touchdown Triple Crown against the Rams.Henry had his sixth career game with at least 200 yards on the ground, tying Hall of Famer O.J. Simpson and Adrian Peterson for the most in NFL history.Henry has also run for at least two TDs in all six of those 200-yard games -- twice as many games with at least 200 yards rushing and two TD runs than any other player in history. Perhaps even more noteworthy is that four of those have come in his last four games against the Texans, meaning Henry has more 200-yard, two-TD games against Houston than any other player has in their entire careers. Hall of Famers Jim Brown, Barry Sanders and LaDainian Tomlinson did it three times.McCaffrey matched another mark held by Tomlinson when he threw, ran and caught a touchdown, becoming the fourth player since the merger to do that in a single game. The last to do it was Tomlinson against the Raiders in 2005. David Patten also did it for New England in 2001 against Indianapolis and Walter Payton did it in 1979 against Minnesota. McCaffrey became the first player to do it while having at least 30 yards rushing, passing and receiving since Gene Gedman did it for Detroit against San Francisco in 1958.Big-play touchdowns are eluding the Pittsburgh Steelers early this season.Pittsburgh's longest offensive touchdown of the season was an 8-yard throw from Mitchell Trubisky to Pat Freiermuth in Week 2 against New England. Six of the Steelers other 10 TDs on offense came from inside the 5, along with two 6-yard scores and a 7-yard pass from Kenny Pickett to George Pickens.The Steelers are the first team since at least 1991 to fail to score an offensive touchdown of at least 10 yards in the first eight games. Five teams in that span had only one: Washington (2015), Cleveland (2009), Denver (2007), the Jets (2005) and Arizona (1994). There seemed to be an invisible fence at the 50-yard line for the Raiders offense at New Orleans.The Raiders failed to cross the midfield stripe for the first 58 minutes of a 24-0 loss to the Saints. Las Vegas didn't run its first play in New Orleans territory until garbage time after the two-minute warning, the second longest a team has gone without crossing the 50 in the past 16 seasons. Arizona didn't do it until the final play of a Week 2 loss to the Rams in 2018.The Raiders nearly became the fifth team since 1991 that didn't cross the 50 for an entire game. The only teams to do that were the Giants in 2006 against New Orleans, Chicago in 2000 against San Francisco, Cleveland in 2000 against Jacksonville and Minnesota in 1991 against New Orleans. Carolina kicker Eddy Pineiro had a game he'd like to forget.Pineiro missed an extra point with 12 seconds left in a tie game after a penalty backed the kick up 15 yards and then missed a 32-yard field goal in overtime in a loss to Atlanta.That marked just the second time in the past 20 seasons that a kicker missed a potential go-ahead extra point in the last 30 seconds of regulation and a potential game-winning field goal in overtime.The only other time it happened was in Week 1 when Cincinnati's Evan McPherson did it in a loss to Pittsburgh. Tom Brady added another record to his resume.Brady was sacked three times last Thursday, giving him 556 in his career -- two more than Ben Roethlisberger for the most for a quarterback in NFL history.Brady has also been sacked by a record 384 players over his career -- one more than Roethlisberger.The defenders who have brought down Brady the most are Aaron Schobel (12), Jason Taylor (11 1/2) and Cameron Wake (10 1/2).Building a big lead hasn't been a problem for the Baltimore Ravens this season. Keeping it hasn't always gone as well.The Ravens became the ninth team to take a double-digit lead in each of the first eight games of the season. While the previous eight combined for a 62-2 record, Baltimore is only 5-3, having blown leads to Miami, the Giants and Buffalo.Three of those eight teams made it to the Super Bowl with the Saints the only one to win it all in 2009. The Patriots (2007) and Dolphins (1984) lost the title game.The only teams to lose even once in that group were the Colts in 2007 and the Giants in 1989.Latavius Murray might eligible for British citizenship.Murray became the third player to appear in two games in London in the same season, following u his trip with New Orleans in Week 4 with one with Denver on Sunday.The only other players to play twice in London in the same season were Gareon Conley (2019) and Adrian Peterson (2017).Murray made the most of his trips abroad, running for a TD in both games and getting the win each time.

(AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty)Farmland inundated with saltwater, gradually eats away the soil in the Mediterranean town of Mutubes, in Kafr el-Sheikh province, Egypt, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022. The impact of climate change has long been obvious to farmers, in the creeping salt that eats away roots and cakes their fields, turning them barren. (AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty)ROSETTA, Egypt (AP) -- Sayed Abuel-Ezz has seen his crops wither from seawater before. As the Nile Delta farmer walks among his mango trees on his land not far from the Mediterranean Sea, he worries it will happen again despite spending the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars to prevent it.\"If it gets higher, the trees will die,\" Abuel-Ezz said, looking towards the sea.Here, the impact of climate change has long been obvious to farmers, in the creeping salt that eats away roots and cakes their fields, turning them barren. They pay a fortune to bring in truckloads of earth to try to raise their crops above the salt pushed into the soil by rising sea levels. But they say it is getting worse. Bus drivers can see the changes too, how the sea more and more easily spills over onto the land. Now every winter, parts of the vital international highway running the length of Egypt's coast are flooded, say drivers on the route. Situated on Egypt's northern coast on the Mediterranean, the Nile River Delta is one of the world's three most vulnerable hot-spots to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, according to a 2007 report by the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.As Egypt hosts the U.N.'s global climate summit COP27 this month, the country's leaders have said the predicament of the Delta, known for millennia for its fertile soil, is foremost among their concerns. Residents are hoping for help to deal with the consequences of a warming planet. The Delta covers roughly 240 square kilometers (93 square miles), starting just north of the capital of Cairo where the Nile River fans out. The rivers' branches created the rich, fertile land by depositing silt as they made their way to the sea. Since ancient times, the area has been the food basket of empires.It's heavily populated, home to some 40 of Egypt's 104 million people and accounts for half of the country's economy, according to the U.N. food agency. Farms and fisheries along the two Nile branches, Rosetta in the west and Damietta in the east, help feed the country and provide products for export.All of that is increasingly threatened by climate change and rising seas. A quarter of the Delta sits at or below sea level. An increase between 0.5 and 1 meter (1.6 to 3.2 feet) -- which could happen by 2100 in one of the U.N.-backed panel's worst case scenarios -- will shift the coastline inward by several kilometers, submerging large areas and rendering more barren with salt. That's according to a recent report by an international group of scientists overseen by the Cyprus Institute's Climate and Atmosphere Research Center and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. \"This would imply severe challenges for coastal infrastructure and agriculture, and can lead to the salinization of coastal aquifers, including the densely populated and cultivated Nile Delta,\" said George Zittis, who co-authored the report.The scenario judged to be more likely by the panel is that the sea will rise by 0.3-0.6 meters by 2100. That will still render thousands of acres unfit for farming or habitation. The Associated Press spoke with more than three dozen farmers, fishermen and other residents in several villages and cities along the Mediterranean coast, the breadth of the Delta.Spanning several generations, they said they have sensed climate change's effects for years, particularly in rising sea levels. They have seen greater shore erosion and groundwater contaminated by salt. The saltwater intrudes as pressure grows from rising sea water, and the counter-pressure from fresh water has lessened. Saltwater intrusion is the most challenging threat to the Delta, said Mohamed Abdel Monem, a senior adviser on land and climate change with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.\"This means less productivity and in many cases crops' death and therefore food insecurity,\" he said.Hamdy Salah, a 26-year-old farmer outside the town of Rosetta in the western Delta, says planting practices have changed drastically. They once grew a variety: tomatoes, eggplants, pumpkins, and other vegetables. Now they grow mostly mango and citrus, which are less vulnerable to salt.\"We tried other crops like apple, but saltwater also killed its roots,\" he said.Abuel-Ezz's family have farmed in Rosetta for generations, and he and his two brothers cultivate two farms of mango and citrus, five acres each. A decade ago, they elevated their farmlands, one field by 1 meter (3.3 feet) and the second by 2 meters (6.6 feet), to combat rising saline water in the body of their farms. It cost them around 2 million pounds (101,700) by today's prices, said Sayed's brother, Saber Abuel-Ezz. The elevation, along with a government-built runoff system meant to reduce salt in the soil, bought them some time. \"It was costly but there was no alternative,\" said Sayed, a 36-year-old father of two. Besides bringing in tons of earth, many cultivate plants in raised beds and use whatever natural or chemical fertilizers they can afford to counteract the saline.Without these measures, the land quickly turns desolate. On the other side of the river from Rosetta town, sheets of dried salt cover former farmland outside the town of Mutubas. On one September afternoon, a half-dozen farmers sat near a machine pumping water from an irrigation canal onto raised beds in a mango farm in Mutubas. The trees have just started to blossom, next year could be their first harvest.Ouf el-Zoughby, one of the farmers, said this is his third time trying to grow mangos. Past attempts have been thwarted by salt. \"You see the tree dying before your eyes,\" the 47-year-old farmer said, remembering how he had to pull the husks out one-by-one. His fields are within 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) of the Mediterranean. This time, he's hoping the newly elevated farmlands and a government-built runoff system will help them survive, in addition to expensive chemical fertilizers. He's not sure what he will do if the crop fails again. He worries that without more government help, thousands could desert their farms.The area has always been exposed to the nearby sea, but formers say salinity was kept in check by supplies of fresh water and silt from the Nile. Even after the construction of the Aswan High Dam in over 50 years ago ended seasonal flooding, fresh water still reached the fields through canals. But even that has lessened, as the government has rationed agricultural water use, to account for the country's growing population. There's no longer enough to wash away the salt. Further down the coast on the eastern side of the Delta, concrete barriers have been put down just outside the city of Port Said, aiming to keep the rising waves back. Abdel-Wahab Ramadan, a 61-year-old retired engineer, remembers spending summer vacations on white sand beaches here 30 years ago. Now, his grandchildren play next to the massive wave breakers in the muddy shallows. \"We are aware that this is necessary, but there are protection methods better than this ugly one,\" he said.They are still just a half measure. They were not enough to stop waves from flooding beach-side restaurants and cafes in the town of Ras el-Bar in recent winters. Many now close during the winter months.\"Last year, we spent a week to repair the place, but unfortunately water flooded it again,\" said Abd Allah Gareib, who manages a cafe by the beach. It sustained water damage the past two years. This year, the sea already crossed the first two lines of wave breakers in October.The barriers and runoff systems are part of government efforts to protect the Delta from climate change's effects.Egypt's former Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel-Atty, said in January the government had installed concrete barriers on 120 kilometers (74 miles) along the Mediterranean coast, meant to shelter 17 million people. That is equivalent to about half the coastline of the Delta and the city of Alexandria. Egypt's entire Mediterranean coast stretches 990 kilometers (615 miles). Abdel-Atty said they were also working to build a warning system to alert any climatic changes like rises in sea levels. At the same time, authorities are trying to put a stop to high-polluting practices, like brick-making and an old farming custom, the burning of rice straw, which shrouds the Delta's skies with smoke every year after the harvest.But there's understanding from Egyptians that this is a small step in tackling a global problem.\"Though Egypt contributes 0.6 of the global carbon dioxide emissions, it is one of the most vulnerable (countries) to the impacts of climate change, and the agriculture sector and food production are the most affected,\" said Abdel Monem, the FAO's expert.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong)BEIJING (AP) -- Access to an industrial zone in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou was suspended Wednesday after the city reported 64 coronavirus cases and workers who assemble Apple Inc. iPhones left their factory in the zone following outbreaks.The announcement did not say whether the isolation of the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone was related to cases at the Foxconn factory. It gave no indication of what prompted the closure. It said no one can enter or leave for one week except to deliver food and medical supplies.Separately, the government reported 64 confirmed cases had been found in Zhengzhou over the past 24 hours. It said 294 asymptomatic cases also had been found in the city of 12.5 million. It did not say how many were in the industrial zone.Meanwhile, the government of Macao announced the southern Chinese territory it will test its 700,000 people on Friday and Saturday. The government said the mass testing is a precaution after an earlier round on Tuesday found no cases.The ruling Communist Party is enforcing a \"Zero COVID\" policy that has closed areas throughout China for weeks to try to isolate every case.That has kept China's infection rate relatively low but has disrupted trade and business at a time when other countries are easing anti-virus curbs. Public frustration with the restrictions has boiled over into fights with police in some areas.In Zhengzhou, everyone in the industrial zone will be tested every day for the coronavirus, the Airport District said. It did not say how many people might be affected.Areas throughout China tightened restrictions on movement and canceled airline flights last month after new infections surged following the weeklong National Day holiday.Residents of many parts of the Xinjiang region in the northwest were barred from leaving their homes in August and September. People in Urumqi and other cities who said they had run out of food and medicine posted appeals for help on social media.Thousands of employees left the Foxconn Technology Group factory starting in mid-October after complaints people who contracted the virus received no treatment. Some accused the company of failing to enforce measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Foxconn said Sunday it was using \"closed loop management,\" an official term for employees living at their workplace and avoiding contact with the outside. The company said ill employees were being treated but did not say if new infections still were occurring.Also this week, visitors to Shanghai Disneyland were temporarily barred from leaving as part of virus testing the city government said Tuesday had extended to 439,000 people. The city health agency said visitors on Monday tested negative and were allowed to leave.Last week, 1.3 million residents of Shanghai's downtown Yangpu district were ordered to stay at home while they were tested.AP Writer Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)When Bruce Boudreau finally got his first chance to be an NHL coach with Washington in 2007, he took over a staff with only a few assistants. George McPhee told Boudreau to coach the way he wanted to coach and he'd be there a while.Boudreau did that, helped the Washington Capitals make the playoffs four times and has spent the bulk of the past 15 years working the same magic around the league. Now with the Vancouver Canucks, Boudreau last week became the second-fastest coach to reach 600 wins, doing so in his 1,049th regular-season game.Along the way, Boudreau has adapted with the changing face of hockey.\"With video and everything and analytics and everything, I think everybody's changed a little bit,\" Boudreau said. \"There's a lot of different dynamics that go into the game right now.\"Boudreau's coaching dynamic has largely stayed the same. As an offensive playmaker in his younger days, he wanted the responsibility to make plays and gives his players now the same trust.\"He gives them freedom to make plays, in the offensive zone in particular, and wants guys to be able to use their skill level and talent,\" veteran defenseman Luke Schenn said. \"He gives you the ability to make plays when it's given. Guys are going to make mistakes at times. He's not going to come and chew you out all the time. Guys know what the expectation is, but he doesn't need to harp on guys.\"That style is part of what endears Boudreau to players. Not that he, like most coaches, can't wear on players when things aren't going well -- and Vancouver's 2-5-2 start is a challenge -- but the hockey lifer also earns respect by valuing what his players and staff do away from the rink.\"He's passionate about the game, and at the same time I think he really, truly cares about his players and he truly wants everybody to be at their best and he wants everybody to succeed,\" Canucks captain Bo Horvat said. \"You can't ask for much more from a coach than to have everybody's back, and you want to have your coach's back when he has your back.\"A big part of having Boudreau's back is stringing together some victories. When Boudreau was on the verge of being the fastest coach since Hall of Famer Scotty Bowman (1,002 games) to 600 career victories, he was thinking much more about getting Vancouver's first of the season.Boudreau, now 67, is in the second year of a two-year contract and it will take many more wins to get the Canucks in the playoffs. But history is on their side: Of the 10 full NHL seasons Boudreau has coached, his team has made the playoffs in nine of them.His players want to get there -- and get him there for at least a chance at his first Stanley Cup.\"You want to win for him,\" Horvat said. \"You want to play hard for him, and you want to run through a wall for the guy. I think that's a good quality to have in a coach, and everybody in this room loves him, so we just got to start winning for him.\"Jesper Bratt was almost a point-a-game player last season for the struggling New Jersey Devils. That didn't stop him from spending the offseason trying to get faster and stronger.Bratt also worked with longtime skills coach Taro Nihei on his shot, which was a point of emphasis from the coaching staff early this season after the Swedish forward passed up some opportunities. The early results are strong: 15 points in nine games, fifth in the NHL -- trailing only established stars Connor McDavid, David Pastrnak, Leon Draisaitl and Artemi Panarin.\"We've been playing some good hockey and it's been exciting and, obviously, it comes from a lot of years with really hard work,\" Bratt said. \"Started feeling probably last year that I took my game to the next level and wanted to continue to do that and worked really hard this summer. The points have been coming in so far.\"So have the points for the Devils, who started 6-3-0. Bratt has been a big part of that and kept up his success even after New Jersey lost two-time Cup-winner Ondrej Palat to injury.Bratt, who also skates with skills coach Daniel Broberg as part of his year-round preparation, is in a contract year after signing a 5.45 million deal for this season. If he keeps this up, his salary could go upwards of 7 million annually.But the 24-year-old knows this is just the start and he'll have to keep it up.\"Most of it comes from hard work and attention to detail and staying on top of pucks and playing well without the puck,\" Bratt said \"That's usually what leads up to some good games. I always try to make a difference for the team every time I'm on the ice.\"The reigning Cup champion Colorado Avalanche face the Columbus Blue Jackets for two games in Tampere, Finland, on Friday and Saturday in the latest chapter of the NHL's Global Series. \"It's going to be fun, for sure,\" said Avalanche forward Artturi Lehkonen, who is Finnish. \"Playing in Finland doesn't happen that often, so for them to see the NHL again too, it's going to be a lot of fun.\"It's also a chance for Colorado, which has lost five of its first nine games, to get away a bit and bond by spending the week in Europe.\"It's good for us,\" coach Jared Bednar said. \"We've got a lot of new players. The start of the schedule's been a little strange, but I think it's good for our team to get out on the road here.\"Early Jack Adams Award front-runner Jim Montgomery, Pastrnak and the Boston Bruins visit the New York Rangers on Thursday night for an Original Six showdown at Madison Square Garden.LEADERS (through Monday)Goals: Connor McDavid (Edmonton), 9; Assists: Leon Draisaitl (Edmonton), 12; Points: McDavid, 18; Ice time: Quinn Hughes (Vancouver), 27:14; Wins: Linus Ullmark (Boston), 6; Goals-against average: Jake Oettinger (Dallas), 1.40; Save percentage: Stuart Skinner (Edmonton), .955.Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhynoAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Sarah Asimrin still hears it from her uncles sometimes: \"You're a girl, it's not right.\" But on a recent evening, the 13-year-old Jordanian was on her club's soccer field practicing alongside other girls and boys. \"I fell in love with the game because it's got action. I love it a lot, more than any other sport,\" said Asimrin. Her younger sister Aya plays soccer as well and, despite the reservations of a few uncles, their family supports them. In fact, their father is a soccer coach at a private academy in the Jordanian capital, Amman.Women's soccer has been long been neglected in the Middle East, a region that is mad for the men's game and hosts the World Cup for the first time this month in Qatar. The women's game has been held back by lack of financing and by conservative attitudes contending that girls aren't made for sports or that uniforms like shorts are too revealing. But some places show signs of momentum. The growth usually depends on active government promotion of women's sports. Where that happens, it taps into pent-up enthusiasm among girls and women and can shift public attitudes.Jordan has been one of the leaders, with one of the region's most successful national teams and a network of girls' youth and school leagues.Others are making new pushes. Last month, the first matches of a new women's Premier League were held in Saudi Arabia, where women have only been allowed to attend soccer games since 2017. The Saudi national women's team played against international teams for the first time this year. Newly launched tournaments give women's teams opportunities for international competition and, proponents hope, will encourage the creation of more teams. The Asian and the much smaller West Asian football associations each held their first women's club championships in 2019. The African federation inaugurated its women's club championship last year in Cairo, and this year's games began this week in Morocco, with a 400,000 prize for the winners -- though that's way below the 2.5 million that the winning men's club gets.The new venues fuel the dreams of young women hoping to reach professional levels. Masar Athamneh, a 20-year-old on the women's team at Amman's Orthodox Club, said she's been playing soccer since she was 12 or 13. She used to join her brother with the boys on the pitches in her neighborhood and watched European leagues on TV. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo has been her idol \"because he worked hard on himself.\" She's hoping to one day play on Jordan's national team in international matches. \"Sometimes we face some difficulties, of course. ... Like, 'This is a game only for boys or males', 'why do you wear shorts?' ... and so on. This is a huge problem we face,\" she said. \"But I think with the time, it's getting better and better.\" Jordan's Football Association provides financial support for clubs to form women's teams, prompting even some conservative clubs to jump in, sports analyst Owni Fraij said. Still, money remains the biggest problem. Clubs treat women's teams that don't generate income \"as a kind of luxury,\" he said.Qatar has lagged behind even other Gulf countries on the international level in women's soccer. But since the tiny nation was named host of this year's World Cup, it has been developing the game with women's teams at many of its universities and holding soccer academies for girls. Egypt perhaps shows the region's starkest contrast. Its biggest men's teams are wealthy powerhouses that win regional tournaments regularly, while women's soccer languishes despite repeated efforts to end its neglect. A single team, Wadi Degla, wins most women's competitions.Egyptian women have faced public backlashes as well. In 2020, a victory by the under-20 national women's team over Lebanon was met by a barrage of sexual harassment on social media, with obscene comments and sneers that girls shouldn't be playing soccer. Administrators' response was even more disturbing. They suspended upcoming games and fired the team's coaching staff, raising fears that the entire team would be disbanded. Players went on TV talk shows and spoke out on social media, and the squad survived.Outside pressure may give Egyptian women a boost. The African Champions League will require clubs in its men's tournament to also have women's teams, which should force the hands of top Egyptian clubs.Where politics and powerful social opposition intersect, girls' enthusiasm for the game never finds an outlet. For example, while women's soccer is relatively active among Palestinians in the West Bank, it's virtually non-existent in the Gaza Strip. Gaza's 2.3 million residents are generally conservative. Its Islamist rulers, the militant Hamas group, grant little space for women's freedoms. The economy has also been crippled by a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade, leaving little to spend on what are considered leisure activities. One of Gaza's few female sports teams is that of the Beit Hanoun Al-Ahli Youth Club, with 20 girls playing soccer and basketball. They wear pants instead of shorts, and long-sleeve shirts. Once they reach 17, they stop playing, often to get married, team manager Maha Shabat said.\"There is no support for women's sports in the Gaza Strip ... no support to be like girls in other parts of the world,\" Shabat said. Rama Ashour, a 14-year-old player on the soccer team, said she hopes to be able to keep going and even play on a national team. \"On the internet, I see many girls (elsewhere) playing normally,\" she said. The largest obstacle in Gaza is society and tradition, but she said she wants to \"think positively about the criticism. I will take it as a motive to proceed and challenge everyone.\"But others on the team are facing up to the limits. \"My ambition -- to be a player -- is something impossible in this society,\" said 16-year-old Hala Qassem. The most tragic setback came in Afghanistan, where the Taliban takeover just over a year ago crushed the nascent women's sports scene. Hundreds of female athletes fled. Australia evacuated the women's national team, and Portugal took in the girl's youth team, while members of the youth development team were flown to Britain.Those left behind have had their lives suffocated by Taliban bans on women's sports and on teen girls going to school and restrictions on women moving around in public. Sabera Akberzada had been playing center on her high school's girls soccer team. Now the 17-year-old can't play or attend school. She has lost contact with most of her teammates.\"Life has become hell for us, as a woman we can't do anything by our choice,\" Akberzada said. She had hoped one day to make it to Afghanistan's national team. \"Unfortunately, my dream remained just a dream.\" A former captain of the women's national team, Khalid Popal, is now in Denmark, trying to keep the sport alive. She's working to get out members of the under-15 team still in Afghanistan.\"I feel so worried and so sorry for women, young women who wanted to be independent,\" she said. \"I don't think women will play sports again in Afghanistan.\"Keath reported from Cairo.

All Rights Reserved.PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bryce Harper hammered his sixth postseason home run, whispered an assist to Alec Bohm before his solo shot and the Philadelphia Phillies tied a World Series record with five homers to rout the Houston Astros 7-0 Tuesday night and take a 2-1 Series lead.Brandon Marsh also homered, and Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins hit back-to-back shots in the fifth inning to chase Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. Philadelphia used the long ball to end the long wait for its first World Series home win since Game 5 of the 2009 World Series. Those Phillies couldn't finish the job.Ranger Suarez tossed three-hit ball over five shutout innings and inched this year's team closer to getting it done.Harper, Bohm, Marsh and the rest of the Phillies on the last team to qualify for the playoffs are two wins away from ending the season as the last team standing. With a sparkling 6-0 record at Citizens Bank Park this postseason, the Phillies just may not return to Texas.NEW YORK (AP) -- Steve Nash is out as Brooklyn Nets coach after a disappointing start and more controversy surrounding Kyrie Irving.The Nets announced Tuesday that they had parted ways with the Hall of Fame point guard, a day after they beat Indiana to improve to 2-5.Nash made it to this season after Kevin Durant said he wanted him out this summer, but not much longer. The Nets have been another mess, with bad play on the court and bad headlines off it.The biggest -- again -- was created by Irving, who posted a link to an antisemitic work on his Twitter page last week, drawing criticism from Nets owner Joe Tsai.Nash led the Nets to a 92-62 record and the playoffs in both full seasons, his first as an NBA coach.

(AP Photo/Ajit Solanki)MORBI, India (AP) -- Scuba divers combed through a river in western India on Wednesday to make certain no bodies were left behind after the collapse of a newly repaired suspension bridge, as officials investigate what led to the tragedy that killed at least 135 people. The 143-year-old pedestrian bridge collapsed Sunday evening, sending hundreds plunging into the waters of the Machchu River in Gujarat state's Morbi town. As rescuers continue to search through the deep and muddy waters, questions have swirled over why the bridge collapsed and who might be responsible. The bridge, built during British colonialism and touted by the state's tourism website as an \"artistic and technological marvel,\" had reopened just four days earlier.As of Tuesday night, 196 people were rescued and all 10 of the injured were in stable condition. Officials said no one was missing according to their tally, but emergency responders and divers continued search efforts. \"We want to be on the side of caution,\" Police Inspector-General Ashok Yadav had said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the site Tuesday to inspect the collapsed bridge and visit injured people at a hospital. He also chaired a meeting with officials and urged for a detailed investigation into what went wrong. Police have so far arrested nine people -- including managers of the bridge's operator, Oreva Group. State authorities also have opened a case against Oreva for suspected culpable homicide, attempted culpable homicide and other violations, and a special investigation team has begun a probe into the incident.A police spokesperson said a First Information Report, the preliminary formal stage of an investigation, stated that the accident occurred due to faulty construction or maintenance-related reasons in addition to the bridge operators' negligence and carelessness.The agency hurriedly opened the bridge for public use despite knowing that their \"callous approach\" in its maintenance and management may lead to accident, the police report said.Yadav, the police officer, said officials would take \"stringent action\" against those found guilty. \"We are collecting scientific and technical evidence,\" he said.As families mourn the dead, attention has shifted to the quality of the renovation and repair work carried out by Oreva, a group of companies known mainly for making clocks, mosquito zappers and electric bikes.On Tuesday evening, prosecutors told a local court that the contractors who oversaw the repair work were not qualified, Press Trust of India news agency reported. Citing a forensic report, the prosecution said that while the bridge's flooring was replaced, its cable was not and so it could not bear the weight of the new flooring, causing the cable to snap. In March, the Morbi town government awarded a 15-year contract to to Oreva to maintain and manage the bridge. The same month, Oreva closed the bridge for seven months for repairs. The bridge, which spans a wide section of the Machchu river, has been repaired several times in the past and many of its original parts have been replaced over the years. It was reopened Oct. 26, the first day of the Gujarati New Year, which coincides with the Hindu festival season. Hundreds of sightseers paid some 17 Indian rupees, roughly 20 cents, to gain entry, according to local media reports.Sandeepsinh Zala, a Morbi official, told the Indian Express newspaper the company reopened the bridge without first obtaining a \"fitness certificate.\" That could not be independently verified, but officials said they were investigating.A security video of the disaster showed it shaking violently and people trying to hold on to its cables and metal fencing before the aluminum walkway gave out and crashed into the river. The bridge split in the middle with its walkway hanging down and its cables snapped.It was unclear how many people were on the bridge when it collapsed. Survivors said it was so densely packed that people were unable to quickly escape when cables began to snap.Modi was the top elected official of Gujarat for 12 years before becoming India's prime minister in 2014. A Gujarat state government election is expected in coming months and opposition parties have demanded a thorough investigation of the accident.India's infrastructure has long been marred by safety problems, and Morbi has suffered other major disasters. In 1979, an upstream dam on the Machchu river burst, sending walls of water into the city and killing hundreds of people in one of India's biggest dam failures.In 2001, thousands of people died in an earthquake in Gujarat. Morbi, 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the quake's epicenter in Bhuj, suffered widespread damage. According to a report in the Times of India newspaper, the bridge that collapsed Sunday was also severely damaged in that earthquake.Associated Press journalist Ajit Solanki contributed.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's National Police Agency on Wednesday raided local police departments in the capital, Seoul, and the city's Yongsan district office as it investigates whether official ineptitude contributed to a deadly crowd surge that killed 156 people in the neighborhood of Itaewon.The raids came a day after the national agency acknowledged that Seoul police failed to act for hours despite receiving at least 11 emergency calls from pedestrians warning about a swelling crowd of Halloween revelers getting out of control ahead of the crush on Saturday in a narrow alley near Hamilton Hotel.The national agency said members of its special investigation unit were retrieving documents and other materials from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Yongsan's police station, district office and fire department and other offices. Local officials and police have faced sharp questions about why they didn't employ crowd controls or sufficient personnel in the small nightlife district despite anticipating a crowd of 100,000 following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in recent months.National police chief Yoon Hee Keun also acknowledged Tuesday that its initial investigations found that police officers failed to effectively handle calls notifying authorities about the potential danger of the crowd gathering in Itaewon.Yoon said police have launched an intense internal probe into the officers' handling of the emergency calls and other issues, including the on-the-spot response to the crowd surge in Itaewon that night.His agency also released the transcripts of 11 calls placed to the police's 112 emergency hotline by pedestrians in Itaewon on Saturday, the first one made around 6:30 p.m., about four hours before the crush near Hamilton Hotel.The unidentified caller, who was in front of a convenience store at the same alley where the crush occurred, pleaded for police to enforce controls on the area because \"too many people are going up and down and it's too scary.\"\"People aren't able to come down but (people) are also pushing up and I think (they) could get crushed to death,\" the caller said. In transcripts of the 11 calls, the callers used the Korean word meaning \"crushed to death\" 13 different times to convey their concerns.South Korea's interior minister and emergency office chief, the Seoul mayor and the head of the Yongsan ward office, which governs Itaewon, have all offered public apologies.As of Wednesday, 156 people were confirmed as dead and 157 were being treated for injuries after they were trampled in a crowd surge centered in a narrow alley that runs between the hotel and a dense row of storefronts.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Exit polls are showing that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a narrow lead in Israel's fifth election in less than four years. (Nov. 2)JERUSALEM (AP) -- After four inconclusive elections, it looks like the fifth time finally worked for Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel's longtime former prime minister and current opposition leader appears to have engineered a surprising victory in the country's fifth national vote since 2019, thanks to help from an extremist far-right party. This alliance could have profound implications, though - potentially ending his legal troubles at home while antagonizing friends abroad.With nearly 90 of the ballots counted Wednesday, all signs pointed to a victory by Netanyahu and his religious and nationalist allies. The count, including 450,000 absentee ballots, was expected to be completed Thursday.Tuesday's election, like the previous four, was seen largely as a referendum on Netanyahu's fitness to rule while facing corruption charges. And once again, opinion polls had been forecasting a continuation of the deadlock that has paralyzed the political system for the past 3 1/2 years. But Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister who has gained a reputation as a political mastermind during a total of 15 years in office, appears to have outsmarted his opponents with a disciplined campaign.Israeli media portrayed Netanyahu as the winner on Wednesday, though he had yet to declare victory and his main rival, acting Prime Minister Yair Lapid, did not concede as vote counting continued.Israelis vote for parties, not individual candidates, and coalition-building is needed to secure a governing majority in parliament. According to official results from Israel's Central Election Committee, the popular vote was almost evenly divided between parties loyal to Netanyahu and those who backed Lapid.But Netanyahu, who has been opposition leader for a year and a half, worked diligently to shore up his bloc of allies with a series of cooperation deals and mergers to ensure that no votes were lost. His ultra-Orthodox religious allies, who joined him in the opposition, worked hard to ensure heavy turnout.Politicians on Israel's left, in contrast, were riven by infighting, leaving one or two small parties below the threshold required to enter parliament. That means that all of their votes are lost. As a result, Netanyahu is expected to control as many as 65 seats in the 120-seat parliament.\"Netanyahu took charge of his bloc and designed a political architecture that had no leakages, that ensured that 100 of the vote contributed to victory, where the other camp was to some extent in disarray,\" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.Netanyahu also tapped into the rising popularity of Religious Zionism, an extremist right-wing party whose leaders are openly anti-Arab and oppose LGBTQ rights.Once seen as a fringe phenomenon, the party emerged as the third-largest in parliament, thanks in large part to the popularity of lawmaker Itamar Ben-Gvir.This alliance could turn out to be a mixed blessing for Netanyahu. If he succeeds in putting together a governing coalition in the coming weeks, Religious Zionism members, along with members of Netanyahu's own Likud party, have made no secret they will seek radical reforms in the country's legal system to benefit Netanyahu.Simcha Rothman, a member of Religious Zionism, said the country's attorney general should worry about her job. Others seek control over judicial appointments and want to pass legislation that would allow parliament to overturn unfavorable court decisions. Ben-Gvir has said he would even press for legislation that would grant immunity and dismiss the charges against Netanyahu, who is accused of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals.\"If the right-wing bloc keeps its advantage in the final tally, Netanyahu will be able to form his dream government,\" wrote Matti Tuchfeld, a commentator in the conservative Israel Hayom newspaper. \"Most importantly perhaps: none of the lawmakers ... will oppose any steps to change the justice system, including steps relating to Netanyahu's trial.\" While this could benefit Netanyahu at home, it could also cause some serious troubles for him on the international stage.Ben-Gvir is a disciple of the racist rabbi, Meir Kahane, whose views against Arabs were considered so repugnant he was banned from the Knesset in the 1980s and whose Kach party was branded a terrorist group by the U.S. Kahane was assassinated by an Arab assailant in the U.S. in 1990.Ben-Gvir, a lawyer who has spent his career defending Jewish extremists accused of violence against Palestinians, has turned himself into one of Israel's most popular politicians, thanks to his frequent media appearances, cheerful demeanor and orchestrated stunts.He has branded Arab lawmakers \"terrorists\" and called for their deportation, and recently brandished a handgun in a tense Palestinian neighborhood of Jerusalem as he urged police to shoot Palestinian stone-throwers. Trying to capitalize on a recent spike in West Bank violence, he and his allies hope to grant immunity to Israeli soldiers who shoot at Palestinians and want to impose the death penalty on Palestinians convicted of attacking Jews. Ben-Gvir has said he will seek the Cabinet post putting him in charge of the national police force. During the campaign, he railed against Lapid for allowing an Arab party to be part of the outgoing government. His campaign slogan, referring to Arabs, called for showing Israel's enemies \"who owns the house.\"While such views have endeared him to his religious and nationalist supporters, they risk creating headaches for Netanyahu, who promotes himself as a global statesman.U.S. President Joe Biden, who has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Netanyahu, is a supporter of Palestinian independence. He is unlikely to take kindly to the combative Ben-Gvir and his colleagues.Likewise, American Jews, who tend to be politically liberal, could also have a hard time backing a government in which Ben-Gvir plays a prominent role.At a meeting last week with American Jewish leaders, Israel's figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, asked the audience to \"respect each other's democracies.\"Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group in Washington, called the results \"deeply troubling.\"\"The likely formation of an ultra-right Netanyahu government should force a moment of serious reckoning for all Americans who care about the nature of the U.S.-Israel relationship,\" he saidMichael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., said that if Ben-Gvir is allowed to push forward with some of his proposals, such as expelling families of Palestinian attackers, it could strain ties.\"I think he's going to pose some challenges,\" Oren said.AP correspondent Eleanor Reich contributed reporting.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - Steve Johnson, brother of U.S. murder victim Scott Johnson, hugs his wife Rosemarie as they arrive at the Supreme Court in Sydney, May 2, 2022, for a sentencing hearing in the murder of Scott. A government inquiry began hearing evidence on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022, of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crime over four decades in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, FILE)CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- A government inquiry began hearing evidence on Wednesday of unsolved deaths resulting from gay hate crimes over four decades in Australia's most populous state where police were notoriously indifferent to such violence.The Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes in New South Wales is the \"first of its kind anywhere in the world,\" a lawyer assisting the inquiry, Peter Gray, said at the hearing's outset in Sydney. The acronym in the title refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people.Responses from Australian society and its institutions including police to violent LGBTQ deaths had been \"sadly lacking,\" Gray said.\"All these lives, of every one of these people, mattered. They mattered to them, to their loved ones, and ultimately to all of us. And their deaths matter,\" Gray said.\"This special commission, by shining a light on everything that is known and can be found out about what happened, will aim to provide some recognition of the truth,\" he added.Violence against gay men in Sydney was particularly prevalent from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s due to increased hostility and fear stemming from the AIDS epidemic, a previous report by an HIV support group, ACON, found.Almost half of the 88 \"gay hate\" and \"anti-gay bias\" deaths in New South Wales between 1976 and 2000 occurred in that period, the report said.They include Scott Johnson, a 27-year-old Los Angeles-born mathematician whose fatal fall from a Sydney clifftop in 1988 was initially dismissed by police as suicide.His killer, Scott White, 52, was sentenced in May to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder.White last week appealed in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal against that conviction, which was based on his guilty plea that surprised his lawyers during a pretrial hearing in January.The trial judge rejected the defense lawyers' application to withdraw his plea. Gray said because Johnson's death was still before the courts, his case would not be part of the new investigation.Johnson's murder was one of several suspicious deaths highlighted in Australian media since the early 2000s in reports on violence against LGTBQ people.Australian attitudes toward LGBTQ people changed rapidly in the late 20th century.In 1958, then-New South Wales Police Commissioner Colin Delaney described homosexuality as the \"greatest social menace\" in Australia.The state decriminalized gay sex in 1984 but allowed a so-called \"gay panic defense\" to charges of murder and other violent crimes until 2014. Also known as the \"homosexual advance defense,\" a criminal could use the victim making a sexual approach as a partial defense. The ACON report was mirrored by a police report on the same 88 deaths between 1976 and 2000. Both reports were published in 2018. ACON considers 30 of the 88 deaths still \"unsolved.\"The police report only considered 86 deaths, excluding a death that occurred interstate and another that was under active criminal investigation. The police considered only 23 of the 86 cases to be unsolved.A parliamentary inquiry then widened the timeframe by examining what it described as \"gay and transgender hate crimes\" between 1970 and 2010. That inquiry found the police force \"failed in its responsibilities to properly investigate cases of historical gay and transgender hate crime,\" undermining LGTBQ confidence in the criminal justice system.That inquiry last year recommended the establishment of the current judicial inquiry with powers to force witnesses to testify.The new inquiry, led by New South Wales Supreme Court Justice John Sackar, will re-examine the 86 deaths during the 24-year window and make its own determination about which ones remain unsolved.The inquiry has also examined New South Wales files of more than 700 unsolved murders and more than 500 missing persons from 1970 until 2010 for potential gay hate and anti-gay bias killings.The inquiry must report by June 30 next year. Gray called for anyone with information about suspicious LGTBQ deaths to come forward.\"Justice in these cases has been long-delayed and long-awaited,\" Gray said.\"This may be the last chance for the truth about some of these historical deaths to be exposed. We need to hear from anyone who can help us do that,\" he added.Police have made efforts in recent years to mend relations with the LGTBQ community.Police apologized in 2016 for violently arresting and beating 53 activists who marched at Sydney's first Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in 1978. Police now officially take part in the iconic annual event.\"Our relationships today, I would say, are positive and progressive. That was certainly not the case in 1978,\" Police Superintendent Tony Crandell said in 2016.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

A major search and rescue operation was underway Tuesday for dozens of people missing after the boat they were on capsized and sank in stormy weather overnight off the coast of an island near the Greek capital. The coast guard said nine survivors, all men, had been found on an uninhabited islet south of the island of Evia and had been picked up by a coast guard vessel. (Greek Coast Guard via AP)ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Rescue crews searching for dozens of migrants missing from the sinking of a sailing boat in rough weather off an island near Athens were recovering mostly bodies on Wednesday, with only one more survivor -- the 12th so far -- plucked from the sea.The coast guard said it had recovered 20 bodies by Wednesday afternoon. Thirty-six people were still reported missing.A total of 12 people, all men, have been rescued and taken to the island of Evia, east of the Greek capital. Eleven of them -- six Egyptians, three Afghans and two Iranians -- were picked up on Tuesday, while a helicopter spotted the 12th in the sea on Wednesday.The initial nine survivors, who had been picked up from an uninhabited islet shortly after the boat sank in the early hours of Tuesday, had told authorities they had set sail from Izmir, Turkey, with a total of 68 people on board. The boat ran into trouble in very rough seas and eventually capsized and sank in the notoriously treacherous Kafireas Strait, between the islands of Evia and Andros. The tragedy was the latest in a series of deadly migrant boat shipwrecks in Greek seas that have left dozens of people missing or dead. A separate search and rescue operation continued for a third day Wednesday in the eastern Aegean off the island of Samos, which lies near the Turkish coast, for seven people still missing after a dinghy reportedly carrying 12 people capsized on Monday. Four people, who the coast guard said were all Palestinians, were rescued on Monday and one body was recovered on Tuesday. Greek Shipping Minister Giannis Plakiotakis, who is also responsible for the coast guard, slammed Turkey on Tuesday for allowing \"ruthless smuggling rings to send people to their deaths, with Greece saving as many as it can.\" Thousands of people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, Asia and the Middle East attempt to enter the European Union through Greece each year.Most make the short but often perilous crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands in often unseaworthy inflatable dinghies. Others opt to attempt to circumvent Greece in overcrowded sailboats and yachts heading straight to Italy.At least 27 people drowned in two separate shipwrecks last month. In one, 18 people died when a boat that had set sail from Turkey sank off the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos. In the other, a yacht carrying about 100 people sank in a gale, killing at least nine and leaving six missing.Follow AP's coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migrationCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Severe tropical storm Nalgae edged closer to Hong Kong on Wednesday and forced businesses to close, but the finance summit that's meant to restore the city's image as an international financial hub pressed ahead. (AP Photo/Bertha Wang)HONG KONG (AP) -- Schools and offices closed and some events were canceled in Hong Kong on Wednesday as Tropical Storm Nalgae swept south of the city, while a finance conference meant to restore Hong Kong's image as an international business center went ahead.As the city braced itself, temporary shelters were opened and theme parks were closed. Afternoon trading was suspended in the stock market, and some ferry and bus services were halted. The Hong Kong Jockey Club scrapped the evening's horse races.The Hong Kong Observatory raised a No. 8 typhoon signal, the third-highest warning under the city's weather system, as Nalgae's maximum sustained winds hit 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour. Residents were urged to stay away from the shoreline and avoid water sport activities, the observatory said.The government halted various public services, ranging from vaccinations to childcare and elderly centers. The storm was passing over waters south of Hong Kong at night before making an expected landfall in southern China on Thursday. As of 8 p.m., the city was left largely unscathed with just nine reports of fallen trees. No reports of landslides or flooding were received, according to the government. While Nalgae was expected to weaken, stiff winds were forecast to affect the city until Thursday morning. The No. 8 warning, which prompted workers to return home, was to remain in force until at least 2 a.m. Thursday. Whether it would be downgraded later would depend on the strength of the storm and its distance from the city, the observatory said.Nalgae killed more than 130 people in the Philippines days ago before moving closer to China's southeastern and southern coastal regions. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China's rule in 1997. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Wednesday declared a state of calamity for six months in four storm-battered regions, including a five-province Muslim autonomous region in the south where rescuers continued to search for villagers feared buried in a huge mudslide in a mountainside community.Associated Press writer Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

They've been driving for decades, unlike in Saudi Arabia, where women gained the right just a few years ago. There are Qatari female ambassadors, judges and ministers, even race jockeys. The emir's mother, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al-Missned, is one of the most famous women in the Arab world. In a region where rulers' wives and mothers keep a low-profile, she behaves like a Western-style first lady -- advocating for social causes and grabbing headlines as a style icon.Yet the emirate has for years sat near the bottom of the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, which tracks gaps between women and men in employment, education, health and politics.It's a traditional society that traces its roots to the interior of the Arabian Peninsula, where an ultraconservative form of Islam known as Wahhabism originated. Rights groups say that the Qatari legal system, based on Islamic law or Shariah, hinders women's advancement. Here's a look at the situation of women in the tiny sheikhdom that has undergone a massive social transformation from a generation ago, when most women kept close to home.Qatar's constitution enshrines equality among citizens. But the U.S. State Department and human rights groups say the Qatari legal system discriminates against women when it comes to their freedom of movement and issues of marriage, child custody and inheritance. Under Shariah law, for example, women can inherit property, but daughters receive half as much as sons. Men can easily divorce their wives, while women must apply to courts from a narrow list of acceptable grounds. Men can marry up to four wives without issue, while women must obtain approval from a male guardian to get married at any age. Under a rule rarely enforced, Qatari women under the age of 25 also must secure a male guardian's permission to leave the country. Husbands and fathers may bar women from traveling. Unmarried Qatari women under 30 cannot check into hotels. Single women who get pregnant face prosecution for extramarital sex. There is no government office dedicated to women's rights.Just last year, emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani appointed women to two Cabinet posts, bringing the number of female ministers to three -- the highest number in Qatar's history. Prominent Qatari women hold other high-level positions, too. The female deputy foreign minister gained prestige as the spokeswoman for Qatar's critical diplomatic efforts amid the U.S. military and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan. Another powerful woman is Sheikh Tamim's younger sister, the head of the Qatar Museum Authority who has become one of the international art world's most popular figures. Last year, Sheikh Tamim appointed two women to the country's advisory Shura Council. But the legislative elections for the 45-member council were a stark testament to Qatari women's limited role. Female candidates did not win a single seat.Laws guarantee the right to equal pay for Qatari women and men. But women do not always receive it. They also struggle to obtain high-level posts in private companies and the public sector, even though more than half of all college graduates are women. There is no law prohibiting gender discrimination in the workplace. Laws ban women from jobs broadly defined as dangerous or inappropriate. Women also must seek permission from a male guardian to work in the government and special institutions. Despite the obstacles, some women have managed to succeed professionally.Traditional roles in Qatar are enshrined in laws that differentiate between women's and men's rights and responsibilities. Wives, for instance, are legally in charge of the household and are required to obey their husbands. They can lose financial support if they defy their husband's wishes. Religious and tribal customs mean that conservative families frown on women mingling with unrelated men, even for business. Although women have made major forays in recent years, the world of politics and finance remains male-dominant.

Aso left for Seoul on Wednesday to meet with South Korean officials as the two countries try to improve ties badly strained by Japanese wartime atrocities. (Kyodo News via AP)TOKYO (AP) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso left for Seoul on Wednesday to meet with South Korean officials as the two countries try to improve ties that were badly strained by Japanese wartime atrocities.At the center of the disputes between the two countries are South Korean court rulings in 2018 that ordered Japanese companies to compensate wartime forced Korean laborers. The Japanese government and the companies have refused to comply with the rulings, saying all compensation issues have been settled under a 1965 normalization treaty and accusing South Korea of violating the international law.But ties have started showing signs of improvement since South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's conservative government took power in May. As key Asian allies to the United States, having a strained relationship also poses a concern for their security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region as it faces growing threats from China and North Korea.Gaffe-prone Aso is also known for his family business' wartime use of forced laborers.In 2008, wartime documents surfaced showing that Korean forced laborers were used at Aso's grandfather's mine, from which he has distanced himself. Aso kept mum when Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry acknowledged that other wartime documents showed that the Aso family mine in Fukuoka, southern Japan, also used 300 British, Dutch and Australian prisoners from April 1945 through Japan's surrender four months later. The trip comes days after a crowd surge in the South Korean capital, Seoul, killed over 150 people. Yoon declared a national mourning period Sunday. Kyodo News Agency said Aso was to meet with Yoon later Wednesday.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said Aso is not representing the government, but is visiting South Korea as the head of a non-partisan Japan-South Korea friendship organization made up of political and business representatives. Matsuno declined to confirm reports that Aso may meet with Yoon, and denied that Aso was carrying a letter from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to Yoon.Another veteran ruling lawmaker, Fukushiro Nukaga, who heads a group of parliamentarians promoting friendship between the two neighbors, was also due to visit South Korea, Kyodo News agency reported. Nukaga is expected to meet with Yoon on Friday. Matsuno said earlier Tuesday that exchanges of lawmakers and private sector representatives between the two countries are a \"meaningful\" way of supporting bilateral relations. He said the two sides need to bring their relations back to \"a healthy state based on friendship and cooperation\" that the two countries have built since the normalization of their ties.\"We intend to continue to closely communicate with the South Korean government,\" he added.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The Polish government said it was acting to prevent a migration crisis at that border. (AP Photo/Michal Kosc)WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Polish soldiers began laying razor wire Wednesday along Poland's border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad after the government ordered the construction of a barrier to prevent what it fears could become another migration crisis.Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said a recent decision by Russia's aviation authority to launch flights from the Middle East and North Africa to Kaliningrad led him to reinforce Poland's 210-kilometer (130-mile) border with Kaliningrad. \"Due to the disturbing information regarding the launch of flights from the Middle East and North Africa to Kaliningrad, I have decided to take measures that will strengthen the security on the Polish border with the Kaliningrad oblast by sealing this border,\" Blaszczak said.Blaszczak said the barrier along the border would be made of three rows of razor wire measuring 2 1/2 meters (eight feet) high and 3 meters (10 feet) wide and feature an electronic monitoring system and cameras. The Polish side also will have a fence to keep animals away from the razor wire.Before now, the sparsely inhabited border area was patrolled but had no physical barrier. To the south, Poland's border with Belarus became the site of a major migration crisis last year, with large numbers of people from the Middle East entering illegally. Polish and other EU leaders accused the Belarusian government -- an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- of masterminding the migration to create chaos and division within the 27-nation bloc.Poland erected similar rolls of razor wire before building a permanent high steel wall on the border with Belarus, which was completed in June.Blaszczak, the defense minister, said the government was persuaded to install fencing near Kaliningrad because of Poland's experience at the Belarus border, where a similar action \"prevented a hybrid attack from Belarus or significantly slowed down this attack.\"The chief executive of Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad, Alexander Korytnyi, told Russia's Interfax news agency on Oct. 3 that the facility would seek to \"attract airlines from countries in the Persian Gulf and Asia,\" including the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. In the last month, Poland's Border Guard agency has not detected anyone attempting to enter the country illegally from Kaliningrad, although a few mushroom pickers wandered into the area by mistake, agency spokeswoman Miroslawa Aleksandrowicz told state news agency PAP.Some in Poland are criticizing the barrier.Zuzanna Dabrowska, a commentator writing for the conservative daily newpaper Rzeczpospolita, wrote Wednesday that the barrier would be ineffective and a hazard because razor wire is dangerous for animals and people who try to cross it. She argued that people from the Middle East and Africa were still trying to illegally enter Poland from Belarus despite the border wall.\"The barrier did not scare them away, because they have no safe retreat, pressured by Belarusian border guards,\" Dabrowska wrote.Poland's government has strongly criticized critics of the Belarus border wall, depicting them as helping those who seek to harm Poland.The exclave of Kaliningrad, with a population of about 1 million, is the northern part of what used to be the German territory of East Prussia and became part of the Soviet Union after World War II.It is home to the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Navy and also an industrial center. Seaside dunes and resorts, what's left of the old Prussian architecture in the city of Kaliningrad, and maritime and amber museums are among the tourist attractions.Soldiers began laying the razor wire in Wisztyniec, the place where the borders of Poland, Russia and Lithuania meet. Lithuania, like Poland, is a member of both NATO and the European Union.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined Wednesday to comment on the Kaliningrad border barrier, describing it as \"a Polish matter.\"Follow all AP stories on global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migrationCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits)COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Despite finishing first in Denmark's election, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen decided to step down along with her Social Democratic government Wednesday in an attempt to build a broader coalition across the political divide.Frederiksen's announcement came after a dramatic vote count in which the center-left bloc that has backed her since 2019 retained its majority in Parliament by a single seat.In theory, the 44-year-old Social Democratic leader could have stayed in power as head of a minority government. But she said she would stick to promises made before Tuesday's election to try to form a wider governing coalition that includes parties on the center-right.\"I am happy, proud, and grateful,\" Frederiksen said. \"It has been a very difficult few years to be prime minister: first the pandemic, now inflation. A lot indicated that a sitting government would not achieve reelection.\"Frederiksen handed her resignation Wednesday to Queen Margrethe, Denmark's figurehead monarch. Frederiksen will remain as prime minister in a caretaking capacity until a new government is formed.Parties that together represent a majority in parliament backed having her lead talks on creating the next government, which the queen was expected to ask the prime minister to do. Frederiksen called the early election last month amid fallout from her government's contentious decision to cull millions of minks as a pandemic response measure. The cull and chilling images of mass graves of minks have haunted Frederiksen since 2020 and eventually led to cracks in the center-left bloc.On Tuesday, the Social Democrats won 28 of the vote, or 50 seats in the 179-member Danish Parliament. Exit polls and early results had suggested the center-left parties together would not gather the 90 seats needed for a majority. They were one seat short until the very end of the ballot count, when the decisive seat flipped.Before that, former Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen appeared set to become kingmaker. His newly formed Moderate party won 9 of the vote for 16 seats, according to a preliminary count of all ballots. Election turnout was 84,1, according to official figures. Lokke Rasmussen, a two-time government leader who lost the 2019 election to Frederiksen and abandoned the center-right Liberal party following an internal power struggle, said he would support Frederiksen's attempt to form a government, but not necessarily with her as prime minister.\"I know for sure that Denmark needs a new government,\" he told jubilant supporters in Copenhagen. \"Who is going to sit at the end of the table? We do not know.\"Election results from Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory which has two seats in the legislature, confirmed early Wednesday that the center-left bloc would have a one-seat majority in Parliament.Some of Frederiksen's former partners expressed disappointment that she opted to seek a broader coalition rather than continue to govern with support from the center-left. Troels Boggild, an associate professor of political science at Aarhus University in western Denmark, said Frederiksen now has two options for forming a new government.\"Either go with the Moderates (at the center) and the Liberals, and if that fails, she can crawl back to the red bloc and form a government there,\" he said. \"By resigning, she shows that her election promises to build a broad center government are serious.\"Frederiksen said a broad coalition would be better placed to face major challenges such as inflation, climate change and shortcomings in the public health care system.Before the election, opposition leaders Jakob Ellemann-Jensen of the Liberals and Soren Pape Poulsen of the Conservatives dismissed the idea of joining forces with Frederiksen, saying they aimed to form a center-right government. The center-right bloc won 73 seats, well short of a majority, after a poor showing by the Liberals.Frederiksen, who became Denmark's youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019 at age 41, teamed up with the opposition to increase NATO-member Denmark's defense spending in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Her steadfast leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was partly overshadowed by the mink-culling episode.The decision to slaughter up to 17 million minks to protect humans from a mutation of the coronavirus was taken in haste and without the required legislation in place. It dealt a devastating blow to Danish mink farmers, even though there was no evidence the mutated virus found among some minks was more dangerous than other strains.Sofie Carsten Nielsen, the leader of the Social Liberal Party and an ally of Frederiksen's first government who forced the prime minister to call the early election, resigned Wednesday. Carsten Nielsen took the blame for her party's setback that the party suffered Tuesday, when it received votes that halved its presence in Parliament. The demise of the Social Liberals followed Carsten Nielsen expressing support for Frederiksen after issuing an ultimatum to withdraw the party's support unless the prime minister called the election.

(AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian slammed his car into an Israeli army officer near a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank Wednesday, seriously injuring him, the Israeli military said. The officer opened fire on the man, the military said, and according to the Palestinians, he died soon after.The Palestinians identified the suspected attacker as Habas Abdel Hafeez Yousef Rayan, 54.The army said in a statement that the attacker arrived in a vehicle at the Maccabim checkpoint on a busy commuting route and struck an officer. The attacker left the vehicle and tried to attack the officer with an axe, the statement said. The officer fired at the man. The officer was injured, according to the army, and transferred to a hospital. Rush-hour traffic was backed up for miles as official cars lined the road, part of a link between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.The Palestinians and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of using excessive force in their dealings with the Palestinians, without being held accountable. The military says it contends with complex, life-threatening scenarios.It was the latest in a spate of violence between Israel and the Palestinians and came as results were still being counted in the country's fifth national election in four years. Results were not final. But turnout was the highest it's been in decades and four fifths of the ballots counted so far show former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared headed toward victory Wednesday as Israelis gave him and his far-right allies what looks like a stable majority in the parliament. More than 125 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli-Palestinian fighting in the West Bank and east Jerusalem this year. The fighting has surged since a series of Palestinian attacks killed 19 people in Israel in the spring, with several more killed in a recent spasm of violence. The Israeli army says most of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting Israeli raids and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. The nightly military raids in the West Bank have contributed to the tension.Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built more than 130 settlements there, many of which resemble small towns, with apartment blocks, shopping malls and industrial zones. The Palestinians want the West Bank to form the main part of their future state. Most countries view the settlements as a violation of international law.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(Taipei Zoo via AP)TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan has welcomed a pair of experts from China to help with an ailing panda in a rare opportunity for contact between the sides.The two experts arrived Tuesday after Taipei Zoo's Tuan Tuan, suspected to have a malignant brain tumor, took a turn for the worse. The giant panda and his mate, Yuan Yuan, were gifted to the zoo in 2008 during a time of warming relations between China and Taiwan, which split amid civil war in 1949.Ties have deteriorated since then, with Beijing cutting off contacts in 2016 following the election of independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen, who was re-elected in 2020. Polls routinely show Taiwanese rejecting China's demand for political unification between the sides, favoring instead the status quo of de-facto independence.China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce. The animals are native to southwestern China and are an unofficial national mascot.An MRI on Tuan Tuan showed that lesions on his brain had grown in a sign the disease was \"progressing rapidly,\" the zoo said in a news release.Zoo spokesperson Eric Tsao said the sides were pooling their knowledge and experience to provide Tuan Tuan with \"the best treatment and the best daily care.\"Chief veterinarian Lai Yen-hsueh said the experts had agreed to hold off on surgery based on the animal's possible reaction to anesthesia and the location of the diseased area. The experts, Wu Honglin and Wei Ming, have long experience working on panda health and reproduction at the main panda research base at Wolong in China's Sichuan province.Pandas, which reproduce rarely in the wild and rely on a diet of bamboo, remain among the world's most threatened species.

Xi on Wednesday affirmed his country's commitment to invest in Pakistan despite obstacles created in recent years by security concerns and the global economic slowdown. (Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via AP)BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday affirmed his country's commitment to invest in Pakistan despite obstacles created in recent years by security concerns and the global economic slowdown. Xi cited the \"all-weather strategic partnership\" between the countries during a meeting in Beijing with newly elected Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Beijing and Islamabad have ties dating from the Cold War, in part due to their mutual tensions with India, with which China has a lengthy disputed border that sparked a 1962 war and more recent clashes. Pakistan and India have fought repeatedly over the Muslim majority Himalayan territory of Kashmir. China has committed tens of millions of dollars to build power plants and other infrastructure in Pakistan, and Xi pointed to transport links to the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar and in the southern trade hub of Karachi as key elements in that effort. Pakistan is a main link in Xi's sprawling \"Belt and Road Initiative\" that aims to build and connect ports, railways and roads to expand trade in a vast arc of countries across Asia, Africa and Europe. Thousands of Chinese workers have been deployed to the project, although not all Pakistanis have welcomed their presence. In April, three Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed when their van was blown up by a suicide bomber. The Chinese fatalities included the director of the Chinese-built Confucius Institute, which offers Chinese language graduate classes, and two teachers. The Baluchistan Liberation Army, a militant group in nearby Baluchistan province that includes Gwadar, claimed responsibility for the attack.The Pakistani Taliban has also targeted Chinese interests in the past, including an attack on a bus last year that killed nine Chinese nationals in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province. Four Pakistanis also died in that attack. Xi touched on the security issue, saying he was \"highly concerned about the safety of Chinese in Pakistan, and hopes Pakistan can provide a reliable and safe environment for Chinese institutions and personnel carrying out cooperation in Pakistan.\" In a statement, Sharif's office said he thanked Xi for \"China's invaluable assistance to Pakistan's relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in the wake of devastation caused by super floods in the country.\" It said the sides agreed to speed up projects and discussed extending Chinese investment in Afghanistan. Peace and stability in Afghanistan, which has teetered on the verge of economic collapse since the Taliban seizure of power last year, would \"promote regional security and economic development,\" Sharif's statement said.\"There was complete unanimity of views between the two leaders,\" his statement said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash laughs with Kevin Durant (7) during the second half of the team's NBA preseason basketball game against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Aaron Gash)Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash asks for a timeout during the first half of the team's NBA preseason basketball game against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Aaron Gash)Steve Nash got paroled.That's the easiest way to say it. Some will say fired, and the official term used Tuesday was that Nash and the Brooklyn Nets agreed \"to part ways,\" which is the popular phrasing these days when a coach leaves a team.But the reality is this: He's free.Whatever happens next in the never-ending string of Kyrie Irving developments won't be taking up Nash's time. The Earth can be flat. Alex Jones can be right about conspiracy theories. Links to antisemitic movies can be shared with millions of followers. The merits of vaccines can be debated.Not Nash's problem anymore.This was never going to work in Brooklyn, and the signs were there long before Nash's first game. Irving made a podcast appearance in the fall of 2020, while the bubble season -- the one that Irving railed against and wouldn't join -- was still going on at Walt Disney World. On that podcast, Irving offered up that the Nets didn't really need a head coach and that it could be \"a collaborative effort\" between himself, Kevin Durant and others.For 99 of the players in the NBA, that statement would be considered wild.It's just another entry on a long list of Irving stories.Irving, it seems, is understanding how deeply his tweet and comment last week hurt some people. He and the Nets announced Wednesday night that they would each donate 500,000 \"toward causes and organizations that work to eradicate hate and intolerance in our communities.\"\"I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day,\" Irving said. \"I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility.\"Among some of what Nash had to deal with during his short tenure with the Nets: the failed attempt to turn Irving, Durant and James Harden into a Big Three; the failed attempt to turn Irving, Durant and Ben Simmons into a Big Three; Irving missing most of last season because he wasn't vaccinated; Harden getting traded; Simmons arriving but not playing last season; Simmons playing this season but not scoring; a slew of other injuries; Durant wanting a trade this summer before backing off that request; and now, the latest Irving saga.For now, that distraction is in the hands of Nets interim coach Jacque Vaughn, who became the eighth coach that Irving has played for -- Ime Udoka could soon become the ninth. The Nets' answer to this circus will, apparently, be to go hire Udoka from rival Boston after he went to the NBA Finals last season but was suspended this season for having an inappropriate relationship with a female Celtics employee.The Nets must love drama. Maybe that's why they wanted to part ways with Nash. Too boring and stable, perhaps.\"Steve Nash is a good friend of mine, so more than anything, I feel for Steve,\" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \"I think he has all the qualities to be a brilliant coach. Brilliant. But it was a good reminder to me and I think to all coaches that we are all at the whim of players, front offices, ownership. You really need a solid situation in which to thrive as a coach in this league.\"Irving will be a free agent this summer. There's no way to predict how that will go. He has incredible talent. He may be the best ballhandler in the game, probably one of the best to ever play. An absolutely elite player, an NBA champion, a perennial All-Star. His skill cannot be argued.Yet it's just impossible to imagine a team committing major money and many years to Irving ever again. Even if he apologizes for sharing the link to antisemitic content -- Irving, for the record, insists he supports all people, all races, all religions -- the damage may have really been done this time.He may have fared better had he quickly followed Meyers Leonard's example.Leonard was with the Miami Heat in March 2021 when, while streaming himself playing a video game, he used an antisemitic slur. Leonard insisted he didn't understand the meaning of the word, apologized almost immediately, got fined 50,000, was admonished by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, was told by the Heat to not be around the team and got traded a few days later.Leonard might not get back to the NBA because of injuries. But he has partaken in multiple acts of contrition -- volunteering with Jewish youth, meeting with representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, holding camps, speaking to groups, and he's done it all with no intention of any of it publicly getting out. He didn't want to look sorry. He wanted to show he was sorry.Irving didn't quickly back down. He made a bad situation worse before Wednesday's announcement, made in conjunction with the Nets and the ADL. And now the Nets will start over with a new coach, plus with some members of the fan base so turned off by Irving that they wore \"Fight Antisemitism\" shirts to a game this week.Irving saw those fans. He spoke to them. One of those fans told the New York Post that the shirts weren't for Irving, but rather for the Nets. They want them to act.A day later, Nash was gone. That probably wasn't the action they wanted.This isn't what Durant signed on for, though the two-time champion in Golden State did ask for Nash to be fired during the offseason. Instead of being part of a title contender, Durant has been part of exactly one playoff series win in his Brooklyn tenure. At 34, he doesn't have an unlimited number of title chances left. It will surprise no one if his trade request reappears later this season, or this summer.It will also be no surprise when another controversy pops up in the next few weeks over something Irving said or tweeted. And when that happens, at least Nash won't be caught up in it all.Tim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Entrance of the courtroom where a former Liberian rebel is on trial in Paris courthouse, Monday, Oct. 10, 2022. Kunti Kamara is notably accused of \"complicity in massive and systematic torture and inhumane acts\" against the civilian population committed in Liberia's Lofa county in 1993-1994. (AP Photo/Francois Mori)PARIS (AP) -- A Paris court on Wednesday found a former Liberian rebel guilty of torture, acts of barbarism and complicity in crimes against humanity during the country's civil war almost 30 years ago, sentencing him to life in prison.Kunti Kamara, 47, had been accused of \"complicity in massive and systematic torture and inhumane acts\" against civilians in Liberia's Lofa county in 1993-1994 as one of the leaders of the Ulimo armed group. He was then less than 20 years old.Kamara repeatedly rejected all the accusations against him during the nearly four-week trial.Prosecutors requested a life sentence while defense lawyers called for acquittal, citing a lack of evidence.\"Your verdict will be historic,\" prosecutor Aurelie Belliot told the court, which was made up of three judges and a jury. \"You must send a clear message: France must not be the last shelter for authors of crimes against humanity.\"Kamara was arrested near Paris in 2018, following a complaint filed by Swiss-based group Civitas Maxima, specialized in helping victims of crimes against humanity.During the investigation, he acknowledged having been a battlefield commander, leading about 80 soldiers during the civil war -- a choice he said he made to defend himself against Charles Taylor's rival faction.With no material evidence because of the chaos of the war, accusations relied on witnesses. During the investigation, French police officers went to Liberia to identify witnesses and interview local residents. About 15 of them came to Paris to testify.Among other crimes, Kamara was accused of having allowed and facilitated rapes and sexual torture of two young teenagers by some Ulimo soldiers.One of the victims vividly described the pain and suffering she endured, crying until she felt unwell and was unable to continue testifying. She wasn't able to come back to the court, and a message from her was read the next day saying she didn't want to see Kamara again.Kamara was also accused of having participated in the killing of two civilians and an act of cannibalism. Described by Belliot as the \"active author of a collective killing,\" he is accused of having eaten the heart of the victim after it had been removed by another soldier with an ax. In addition, he was accused of having killed a sick woman, firing at her head with a rifle, and of having compelled people into forced labor under inhuman conditions. He and his group allegedly forced civilians to carry very heavy loads, including electric generators and food, for hours without food and water. Accusations also included the torture of a man, whose arms were tied behind his back before being dragged on the floor until he was very seriously wounded.The trial by the Paris criminal court has been made possible under a French law that recognizes universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity and acts of torture.Prosecutor Claire Thouault stressed that Liberia never sent to trial those who committed crimes during the country's back-to-back civil wars between 1989 and 2003 that killed an estimated 250,000 people.She said that as soon as he arrived in Europe, Kamara \"did everything to hide the reality of his actions and avoid any accusation.\"Kamara said he left Liberia after the end of the first civil war in 1997 and later went to the Netherlands. He acknowledged he lied about his past to get asylum there, including by not disclosing he used to be an Ulimo soldier. He was later granted citizenship and lived in the country for 12 years, before coming to Belgium and then France because prosecutors alleged that he felt his war activities were getting increasingly known by Dutch authorities. Rights groups hailed the trial as an important step to bring justice to victims.Speaking ahead of the verdict, Sabrina Delattre, lawyer for Civitas Maxima, said because \"there is total impunity in Liberia\" for war criminals, \"it's very important for the victims that this trial took place. It's really important that they were able to come here and give their testimony before the court.\"The country's post-war truth and reconciliation commission in 2009 recommended prosecution for dozens of ex-warlords and their commanders bearing greatest responsibilities for the war. But successive governments have largely ignored the recommendations, much to the disappointment and frustration of war victims.The trial in Paris followed a related case in Switzerland, where a court in June 2021 convicted a former Ulimo commander, Alieu Kosiah, to 20 years in prison for the rapes and killings of civilians among other crimes. Kosiah was the first Liberian convicted of war crimes dating from the first civil war. He appealed the decision. Kosiah's statements involving Kamara partly led to the arrest of his former comrade-in-arms.Alexander Turnbull and Oleg Cetinic contributed to the story. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Simon does not know what will happen in 2023, promising a decision \"no later than the end of the first quarter of next year.\" (AP Photo/Tim Heitman)FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The man in charge of women's professional tennis, Steve Simon, has been sitting close enough to the action at the season-ending WTA Finals this week -- from a seat in front of the front row, as courtside as can be -- that a player easily could wander over for a mid-match chat.Hasn't happened. Probably won't, of course. Simon does say he interacts with the sport's athletes plenty year-round -- \"I'm not pen pals with all of them, per se; I'm not going to flop down on the sofa next to them, per se ... but I think we have a good relationship\" -- and listens to their concerns, many of which lately can be summed up by one particular word. \"Everyone's looking for stability,\" WTA Tour Chairman and CEO Simon said during an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday at Dickies Arena, which has a one-year deal to host the tournament for the top eight singles players and top eight doubles teams through next Monday, before giving way to the site's usual mix of monster trucks, rodeo shows, indoor lacrosse and concerts by acts such as George Strait and the Eagles.One unresolved issue for Simon, with an underlying cause that troubles him and players alike, is when the tour's events, including the WTA Finals, will return to China. A year ago, the WTA suspended all tournaments in that country because of concerns about the safety of Peng Shuai, a Grand Slam doubles champion who accused a former government official there of sexual assault. Simon wanted a full and transparent inquiry into her allegations and a chance for the tour to communicate with her -- none of which has happened yet. Peng immediately disappeared from public view, then tried to recant. She doesn't leave China and was part of carefully orchestrated appearances during the Beijing Olympics in February.\"All I can do is think about her and hope she's doing well,\" said Coco Gauff, an 18-year-old American entered in singles and doubles in Fort Worth. \"We were told she is, but you never know.\"Shenzhen, China, was supposed to hold the WTA Finals through 2030, but the pandemic scrapped those plans in 2020 and 2021. Simon does not know what will happen in 2023, promising a decision \"no later than the end of the first quarter of next year.\"\"We hope that that's where we're going to be,\" he said, \"but, obviously, we have some issues to resolve.\"He named two: Peng's situation and lingering coronavirus restrictions.\"We do need to resolve Peng. ... We're comfortable that she's safe, and we know she's in Beijing, which is great. We want that. But we haven't received the assurances that we want with respect to the investigation that we requested,\" Simon said. \"What's the real story? That's all we've asked for. What's the story? She obviously had great courage to come forward with what she said. The principles that are involved are right in line with what we stand for as an organization. And what we've asked for is an investigation to understand what occurred, what didn't occur, and then address it appropriately.\"The placement of the WTA Finals in Fort Worth wasn't announced until September -- the scheduling that placed it right before the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Scotland next week drew some criticism -- and there were thousands of empty seats during the first two days of competition. Simon called it \"a very last-minute destination\" and referred to the venue as \"probably a little big for us, but a beautiful arena.\"Even No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek made note of that, telling the crowd after her victory Tuesday night: \"Hopefully we're going to see a full house soon.\" Simon said he's spoken with Simona Halep, the two-time Grand Slam champion and former top-ranked player who was provisionally suspended 1 1/2 weeks ago after testing positive for a banned substance at the U.S. Open in August. \"I believe her that she didn't intentionally do something here. That being said, I do believe very strongly in our anti-doping program, and I think it's a good one, and our players support it, too. And if you ask Simona, she supports it,\" Simon said. \"I'm very confident that as we go through the process, the truth is going to come out, and we will deal with it accordingly. But I have a lot of sympathy for Simona, because I would never question her integrity.\"AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.Two Newark police officers were wounded in a shooting Tuesday afternoon (Nov. 1) in a residential neighborhood about a mile west of the city's airport, officials said. (Nov. 1)NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A man charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting two Newark police officers was taken into custody Wednesday, after hiding out overnight in the apartment building he'd fled to a day earlier. Police arrested Kendall Howard shortly after 11 a.m. Wednesday and charged him with two counts of attempted murder and weapons offenses. Television news video shot from overhead showed Howard being carried out by four police emergency response personnel, with his hands handcuffed behind his back. Police had arrived at the apartment building early Tuesday afternoon after a citizen called and said he recognized a man shown on a flyer who had been involved in an Oct. 28 shooting, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said Tuesday. When they arrived, they encountered the 30-year-old Howard in the parking lot as they were exiting the building, police said. After an altercation, Howard allegedly pulled a gun and fired at both officers, injuring one in the leg and the other in the shoulder.Both officers are expected to make full recoveries, Essex County Prosecutor Theodore Stephens II said at a news conference Wednesday. One was expected to be released from the hospital Wednesday and the other within the next few days, he said. Both have been on the job for 18 months.Stephens didn't provide details on how Howard was able to evade capture overnight in the six-story apartment building, which is near Newark's Weequahic Park and a little over a mile from Newark Liberty International Airport. The building contains more than 80 apartments, Stephens said, and it took a long time to evacuate residents. He didn't say where in the building Howard was found. Stephens and Baraka praised the efforts of citizens who aided the injured officers, particularly a woman who got out of her car and tried to assist one of the officers, who was bleeding. A video taken by a bystander and posted online appeared to show someone helping an officer off the ground and soon after, others in uniform helping the limping officer into a car.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Nepal's governing alliance is pledging to create a stable government that will be able to complete a full five-year term in the Himalayan nation that has had 13 different governments in the past 16 years.The alliance of four political parties is contesting Nov. 20 parliamentary elections together in hopes of retaining power. \"Our commitment is that the next government will complete the full five-year term and provide the country with stability because we will keep our partnership intact,\" Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the leader of the Maoist communist party Pushpa Kamal Dahal, a key member of the alliance, said in an interview Wednesday.Political stability is much needed in the country, where frequent changes in government and squabbles among parties have been blamed for delays in writing the constitution and slow economic development.No government since the abolition of the centuries-old monarchy in 2008 has completed a full term.Dahal said the parties in the governing alliance have pledged to remain together for parliament's full five-year term after the election, which he claimed they will comfortably win against a bigger communist party and its partners.The alliance's biggest competition is the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) headed by Dahal's one-time partner, Khadga Prasad Oli.Dahal and Oli had merged their groups into a big communist party which contested the 2017 parliamentary election and won a majority of seats, leading to hopes of a stable government.Oli then became prime minister, but midway through the five-year term he refused to comply with an agreement that Dahal would become leader for the remaining period. Dahal, unhappy with Oli, split from the party, ending the government's tenure.Dahal said there would be no breakup in the present governing partnership. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress party is the biggest in the group and is the country's oldest party.Although the alliance has agreed to contest the election together, they have not decided who will become prime minister if it wins, he said.Dahal, also known as Prachanda, or the \"fierce one,\" led a violent Maoist communist insurgency from 1996 to 2006. More than 17,000 people were killed and the status of many others remains unknown.The Maoists gave up their armed revolt and joined a U.N.-assisted peace process in 2006 and entered mainstream politics. Dahal's party secured the highest number of parliamentary seats in 2008 and he became prime minister, but he quit a year later over differences with the president. Dahal said his party is contesting the election as part of an alliance this year but will work to become the largest before the next polls.\"We will become the No. 1 party after five years,\" he said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

National elections will be held on Nov. 19. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian)KLANG, Malaysia (AP) -- Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim appealed to voters Wednesday for another surprise victory when Malaysia goes to the polls later this month, as he faces challenges from a resurgence of ethnic Malay support for rival parties.Anwar's Pakatan Harapan), or Alliance of Hope, won a stunning victory in 2018 and aims to repeat its success on Nov. 19. The victory was short lived after defections caused the government to collapse in early 2020 and brought back to power the Barisan Nasional coalition led by the United Malays National Organization.Speaking at the launch of his alliance's election manifesto, Anwar said PH is more united now after being purged of members who were not committed to its reform agenda.\"To save this country from endless political turmoil and corruption, I appeal to the people to give their support so that PH can emerge with a clear majority in the upcoming election,\" he said.Anwar didn't participate in the 2018 vote because he was in prison on a sodomy conviction he said was politically motivated. The PH campaign was led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who became the world's oldest leader at 92 after its victory. Anwar was pardoned shortly afterward and was to take over the baton from Mahathir. But distrust and infighting led to the collapse of the government sparking political turmoil that has continued under the new governments that took power.Malaysia has had three prime ministers since the 2018 polls. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob dissolved Parliament on Oct. 10, nine months ahead of schedule, buckling to pressure from UMNO for early polls despite the risk of floods during the yearend monsoon season.Anwar's alliance faces challenges not just from UMNO's National Front, but also from a number of Malay parties including a new one set up by Mahathir. The addition of about 6 million new voters, including many young people, also adds to the uncertainty.Anwar is often accused by his Malay rivals of not championing the rights of ethnic Malays. Recent by-election victories by UMNO appeared to indicate that rural Malays who abandoned the party in 2018 have returned to its fold. Malays comprise about two-thirds of Malaysia's 33 million people, with large Chinese and Indian minorities.Anwar said he isn't apologetic for running on a multiracial platform. He said race and religion have long been used by UMNO and other Malay leaders to garner support, but that such an approach is outdated. He said poverty, for example, affects other minority groups in addition to Malays, and that preferences given to Malays in contracts are often abused by those in power to enrich themselves.With the slogan \"We Can,\" Anwar said PH's manifesto will prioritize 10 key issues including sustainable growth, combating corruption and boosting the country's competitiveness. If it wins, he said a key task will be to resuscitate the economy and address the rising cost of living, a concern of voters amid a weakening currency and an expected economic slowdown next year.\"I appeal to the people to give a chance for PH to emerge as a clear winner ... so that we are not given ultimatums, and free from threats to save this country from endemic corruption and abuse of power,\" he said.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.This photo provided by Volkswagen shows the 2022 Volkswagen GTI, a hatchback sedan with sleek looks and 300 horsepower. (James Lipman/Courtesy of Volkswagen of America via AP)This photo provided by Kia shows the 2022 Kia Stinger, a sporty hatchback sedan with an available 368-horsepower turbo V6 engine. (Courtesy of Kia America via AP)Do some shopping for a new midsize sedan and you'll find that just about every model provides high levels of comfort and the latest in technology and safety. But what if you also want it to be stylish and engaging to drive while also still being practical? Consider the Volkswagen Arteon and Kia Stinger. The Volkswagen Arteon tends to fly under the radar of most shoppers, but it's notable for its premium interior, athletic handling and comfort. It also has a hatchback-style trunk that's easy to load and has plenty of space. For 2022, the Arteon addresses one of its prior shortcomings, as it gains a more powerful engine, upping the horsepower by 12.The Kia Stinger is another sleek and sporty sedan with a hatchback. Like the Arteon, it has an upscale interior, standout styling and plenty of power. The Stinger also received several improvements for 2022, including revised styling, a larger center touchscreen and an upgraded base engine. Which of these superb but mostly unnoticed competitors is the better buy? Edmunds' car experts find out. Both the Arteon and Stinger are powered by strong engines. The base Stinger GT-Line is propelled by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 300 horsepower. The top GT2 trim boasts a powerful turbocharged V6 that pumps out 368 horsepower. The V6 has an EPA estimate of 20 mpg combined with rear- or all-wheel drive. The four-cylinder gets 25 mpg with rear-wheel drive or 24 mpg with all-wheel drive. Every Arteon comes with a 300-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine. With front-wheel drive, which is only available on the base SE R-Line trim, it's the most efficient powertrain here with an EPA-estimated 28 mpg. The two higher trims come standard with all-wheel drive that results in 25 mpg combined. The Arteon has the potential for greater fuel efficiency, but the ability to upgrade to the Stinger's available V6 is ultimately more compelling.Winner: Kia Stinger The Stinger and Arteon are true sport-centric sedans that are entertaining to drive and sure-footed when the road gets twisty. The Stinger's steering is light and precise, making the car feel nimble and responsive. When in Sport mode, the Arteon's adaptive suspension, which improves handling and comfort, tightens up and helps keep the car well composed around corners. Both vehicles instill confidence in the driver. If you prefer straight-line speed, you'll love the Stinger's turbocharged V6. It's by far the quickest, hitting 60 mph in 5.0 seconds when Edmunds tested it. It took the Arteon 6.0 seconds, and 6.2 seconds for the Stinger with the turbo-four engine. Comfort does take a bit of a back seat. Driving over large road imperfections can be a little jarring in the Arteon. Similarly, rough pavement can make the Stinger's ride busy. Both cars have firm seats, but the Arteon's are slightly more comfortable. As for cargo, both provide more cargo space than a typical sedan thanks to their hatchback-style trunks, but you'll be able to fit more stuff in the back of the Arteon. Winner: Volkswagen Arteon The Arteon's starting price of 43,825 is relatively high. But it does include some appealing standard features such as an adaptive suspension system and a digital instrument panel. The range-topping SEL Premium R-Line trim passes the 50,000 mark and comes equipped with heated and ventilated massaging front seats and a self-parking system. With a starting price of 37,695, the Stinger is not only more affordable but also offers comparable standard features minus the adaptive suspension, and you get a larger touchscreen display. The Stinger's top GT2 trim also tops 50,000 but includes performance-oriented features you can't get in the Arteon such as a powerful V6 engine, Brembo brakes and an upgraded rear differential for improved traction. Both rivals come standard with a full suite of advanced driver aids. Most worked well during testing, but we noticed the Stinger's lane centering system would ping-pong the sedan between lanes and the Arteon's adaptive cruise control was slow to accelerate. The Stinger offers a five-year/60,000-mile basic warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. You also get five years of roadside assistance. With the Arteon, you get a shorter four-year/50,000-mile basic and powertrain warranty and three years of roadside assistance. However, it also includes two years of free scheduled maintenance. Winner: Kia StingerBoth the Kia Stinger and Volkswagen Arteon are compelling choices that offer lots of performance, comfort and tech. It was a close race, but the value-packed Stinger's lower starting price, more available power and longer warranties make it the better buy.

Marles on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022 played down the significance of a major upgrade of B-52 facilities planned for northern Australia that has raised China's ire, saying the nuclear-capable U.S. bombers had been visiting since the 1980s. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, File)CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia's defense minister on Wednesday played down the significance of a major upgrade of B-52 facilities planned for northern Australia that has raised China's ire, saying the nuclear-capable U.S. bombers have been visiting since the 1980s.China this week condemned U.S. plans to deploy up to six of the long-range bombers at Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal in the Northern Territory, arguing the move undermined regional peace and stability. China also warned of a potential arms race in the region.Asked if the upgrade could prove too provocative, Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters, \"I think everyone needs to take a deep breath here.\"The multibillion-dollar U.S. investment is part of the Enhanced Air Cooperation Program, which has built on a range of air exercises and training activities between the two countries since early 2017.\"What we're talking about is a U.S. investment in the infrastructure at Tindal, which will help make that infrastructure more capable for Australia as well,\" Marles said.\"In terms of U.S. bombers, they've been coming to Australia since the 1980s. They've been training in Australia since 2005. All of this is part of an initiative which was established in 2017,\" he said.Australia would be a \"significant beneficiary\" of the Tindal upgrade, Marles said.Some Australian critics argue the B-52s' increased presence in northern Australia, made possible by the new facilities, would make the country a bigger target in a war between the United States and China.Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at the Australian Security Policy Institute think tank, said China and other observers were \"hyping\" and \"over-egging\" the significance of what was proposed.\"This is not significant in terms of the hardware side of things. It is significant in terms of the strategic importance of the fact that we are now able to more easily support the U.S. in its operations in the region,\" Davis said.The U.S. Air Force would be able to operate B-52s for longer and with more ease from Tindal with an expanded parking apron, hangars and fuel storage tanks, Davis said.\"It also means that in a crisis, Australia is then one of the few locations that the B-52s can more easily operate from to support U.S operational requirements,\" he said.Tindal, like the U.S. Pacific military bases in Guam, is within range of Chinese long-range missiles.But the greater distance the missiles would have to fly make Tindal an easier target to defend, Davis said.Speaking during a visit to Thailand, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said governments led by both of Australia's major parties \"have worked to increase coordination and interoperability with the United States and with others.\"She said that contributes to \"the strategic equilibrium\" in the Asia-Pacific region, and the basing of B-52s \"is consistent with the approach Australia has taken over a number of years to increase our capacity to operate with the United States.\"She said Australia welcomes increased U.S. involvement in the region under the Biden administration.Wong said she hoped that deteriorating relations between Australia and China would improve.\"I've put the view publicly that we think it's in both countries' interest for the relationship to be stabilized,\" she said.-----Associated Press video journalist Tassanee Vejpongsa in Bangkok contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Two of the largest U.S pharmacy chains have agreed in principle to pay about 10 billion combined to settle lawsuits over the toll of powerful prescription opioids, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022. In addition to the deals with CVS Health and Walgreens, a lawyer for local governments says settlement conversations are continuing with Walmart. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)The two largest U.S. pharmacy chains, CVS Health and Walgreen Co., announced agreements in principle Wednesday to pay about 5 billion each to settle lawsuits nationwide over the toll of opioids, and a lawyer said Walmart, a third pharmacy behemoth, is in discussions for a deal.The prospective settlements are part of a shift in the legal landscape surrounding the opioid epidemic. Instead of suspense over whether companies in the drug industry would be held to account through trials or settlements, the big question is now how their money will be used and whether it will make a difference in fighting a crisis that has only intensified.The deals, if completed, would end thousands of lawsuits in which governments claimed pharmacies filled prescriptions they should have flagged as inappropriate. With settlements already proposed or finalized between some of the biggest drugmakers and distribution companies, the recent developments could be the among the last multibillion-dollar settlements to be announced. They also would bring the total value of all settlements to more than 50 billion, with most of it required to be used by state and local governments to combat opioids, which have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. over the last two decades.\"It's one more culprit of the overdose crisis that is having to pay their dues,\" said Courtney Gary-Allen, organizing director of the Maine Recovery Advocacy Project. \"Average Americans have been paying it for a long time.\"Gary-Allen, who is a member of a council that will help determine how Maine uses its opioid settlement funds, said more money to address the problem will help. In her state, she said, the needs include more beds for medical detox and for treatment.Neither Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS nor Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens is admitting wrongdoing.The plans spring from mediation involving a group of state attorneys general. Before they move ahead, state and then local governments would need to sign on. So far, the detailed, formal deals have not been presented to the government entities so they can decide whether to join.Under the tentative plans, CVS would pay 4.9 billion to local governments and about 130 million to Native American tribes over a decade. Walgreens would pay 4.8 billion to governments and 155 million to tribes over 15 years. The exact amount depends on how many governments join the deals.Both noted they have been addressing the crisis through such measures as starting educational programs and installing safe disposal units for drugs in stores and police departments. And both said the settlements would allow them to help while staying focused on their business.\"We are pleased to resolve these longstanding claims and putting them behind us is in the best interest of all parties, as well as our customers, colleagues and shareholders,\" Thomas Moriarty, CVS chief policy officer and general counsel, said in a statement.Walgreens said in a statement: \"As one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation, we remain committed to being a part of the solution, and this settlement framework will allow us to keep our focus on the health and wellbeing of our customers and patients, while making positive contributions to address the opioid crisis,\" Walgreens said in a statement.Paul Geller, a lawyer for governments in the lawsuits, said talks with Walmart continue. Walmart representatives would not comment Wednesday.\"These agreements will be the first resolutions reached with pharmacy chains and will equip communities across the country with the much-needed tools to fight back against this epidemic and bring about tangible, positive change,\" lawyers for local governments said in a statement. \"In addition to payments totaling billions of dollars, these companies have committed to making significant improvements to their dispensing practices to help reduce addiction moving forward.\"If these settlements are completed, they would leave mostly smaller drug industry players as defendants in lawsuits. Just this week, a group of mostly regional pharmacy chains sent to a judge, who is overseeing federal litigation, information about claims they face, a possible precursor to scheduling trials or mediating settlements involving some of those firms.\"One by one, we are holding every player in the addiction industry accountable for the millions of lives lost or devastated by the opioid epidemic,\" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. \"The companies that helped to create and fuel this crisis must commit to changing their businesses practices, and to providing the resources needed for treatment, prevention and recovery.\"Most of the nation's opioid overdose deaths initially involved prescription drugs. As governments, doctors and companies took steps to make them harder to abuse and obtain, people addicted to them increasingly switched to heroin, which proved more deadly.In recent years, opioid deaths have soared to record levels around 80,000 a year. Most of those deaths involve illicitly produced version of the powerful lab-made drug fentanyl, which is appearing throughout the U.S. supply of illegal drugs.Only a handful of opioid settlements have had bigger dollar figures than the CVS plan. Distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson this year finalized a combined settlement worth 21 billion, and drugmaker Johnson  Johnson finalized a 5 billion deal.Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and members of the Sackler family who own the company have a proposed settlement that would involve up to 6 billion in cash, plus the value of the company, which would be turned into a new entity with its profits used to combat the epidemic.

Kenya is sending more than 900 military personnel to eastern Congo to join a new regional force trying to calm deadly tensions fueled by armed groups that have led to a diplomatic crisis between Congo and neighboring Rwanda. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga)GOMA, Congo (AP) -- Kenya's president said Wednesday that his country is sending more than 900 military personnel to eastern Congo to join a new regional force tasked with trying to calm deadly tensions fueled by armed groups.Kenyan President William Ruto called the mission \"necessary and urgent\" for regional security, and said he and Congo's president had agreed on how Kenyan forces would work with Congolese and other forces on disarming rebels and peacekeeping.The Kenyan forces will be based in Goma, eastern Congo's largest city. The East African Community regional force, agreed upon by heads of state in June and led by a Kenyan commander, also has two battalions from Uganda, two from Burundi and one from South Sudan.Late Tuesday, angry crowds set fire to United Nations vehicles in Goma as frustrations mount over the advance of M23 rebels and the deteriorating security situation in the country's east.Violence by armed groups has led to a diplomatic crisis between Congo and neighboring Rwanda. Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting the rebels, which Rwanda denies while accusing Congo of backing another rebel group hostile to Rwanda.The U.N. vehicles were targeted in Goma amid false rumors that the U.N. had transported rebels, adding to the dissatisfaction many people in eastern Congo have with the efforts of a peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO.\"Because of these rebels, we have fled our homes in Rugari, Kibumba,\" protester Kasereka Munyafura said, standing next to the truck on fire. \"That is why we are angry, and we have just burnt the vehicles of MONUSCO because it makes us suffer.\"Earlier Tuesday, the U.N. peacekeeping mission announced a \"strategic and tactical withdrawal\" from embattled Rumangabo. The M23 rebels have been trying to advance on the town, which houses a military base.The M23 rose to prominence more than a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, which sits along the border with Rwanda. After a peace deal, many of M23's fighters were integrated into the national military.The group reemerged last November, saying the government had failed to live up to its decade-long promises. Over the weekend, the rebels doubled the territory they hold, seizing control of two major towns.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - CVS in Wadsworth Plaza in Philadelphia, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021. CVS Health reports quarterly financial results Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)CVS Health booked a third-quarter loss of more than 3 billion after setting aside money for a potential opioid litigation deal but still beat expectations and raised its 2022 forecast. The health care giant detailed on Wednesday a planned nationwide settlement of lawsuits over how it has handled prescriptions for powerful painkillers linked to an overdose epidemic. The company recorded in the recently completed quarter a 5.2 billion pretax charge for the settlement. That covers payments over 10 years, starting next year.CVS CEO Karen Lynch told analysts Wednesday morning that the company has a \"high degree of confidence\" that states will accept the deal. She noted that state attorneys general were at the negotiating table when CVS Health began discussions late last month.Mizuho Securities USA analyst Ann Hynes said in a note that the payments should be manageable for the company and won't hurt CVS Health's growth. She also noted that the deal removes a big uncertainty hanging over the stock.CVS Health also recorded a 2.5 billion loss in the quarter on assets held for sale to write down the company's struggling Omnicare long-term care business. Lynch told analysts the company was \"actively exploring strategic alternatives\" for the business. CVS Health also saw sales growth in the quarter from all three of its main businesses as total revenue climbed 10 to 81.2 billion. Adjusted earnings, which don't count one-time items like the settlement, totaled 2.09 per share. Analysts expected, on average, adjusted earnings of 2 per share on 76.74 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. CVS operates one of the nation's largest drugstore chains with nearly 10,000 retail locations. It runs prescription drug plans for big clients like insurers and employers through a large pharmacy benefit management business.It also provides health insurance for more than 24 million people through its Aetna arm.Prescription growth fueled an 11 jump in revenue from the company's largest segment, the pharmacy benefit management business.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also continues to help sales. Company leaders said they expect more than 3 billion in revenue this year from vaccinations, diagnostic testing for the virus and test kits sold over the counter or without a prescription. But Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin cautioned against expecting a similar level of sales going forward. CVS Health now expects adjusted earnings of 8.55 to 8.65 per share for this year, a higher and narrower forecast than it made in August.FactSet says analysts predict, on average, earnings of 8.55 per share.Guertin said CVS Health's initial goal for 2023 is to grow adjusted earnings to a range of 8.70 to 8.90 per share. The company will provide a detailed forecast early next year.Analysts are looking for 9.07 per share next year. Shares of CVS Health Corp., based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, climbed 5, or 4.63, to 99.25 Wednesday afternoon while broader indexes slipped.Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: thpmurphyCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Themba Hadebe, File)BERLIN (AP) -- Not every big soccer star will be playing at the World Cup.Some will be missing from the tournament in Qatar because of injuries or because their countries didn't qualify, including Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema of France and runner-up Sadio Mane of Senegal. Those two -- voted the world's top two players this year -- were ruled out of the World Cup with injury days before kickoff. Other star names will also be watching from afar.KARIM BENZEMA (France)There's now no chance of Benzema adding a World Cup title to his Ballon d'Or award this year after he tore a left thigh muscle training with the French squad in Qatar days before the defending champion's opening game. The World Cup was meant to continue a remarkable comeback for Benzema, who did not play in France's victorious 2018 World Cup campaign because he was still exiled from the team for his role in a sex-tape scandal. That led to a dramatic fall for Benzema but he had won back fans with a stellar season with Real Madrid and was back at his best for France. His injury came in his first full training session with the French World Cup squad, which is now missing five players.SADIO MANE (Senegal)Senegal's all-time leading scorer also saw his World Cup disappear when he injured his right leg in a club game for Bayern Munich two weeks ago. Senegal held out hopes that its talisman might recover and play some part later in the tournament and included him in its squad. But those hopes were quashed when Bayern announced this week that Mane has had surgery to reattach a tendon to his right fibula and is definitely out of the World Cup. Africa's best player will now watch his team while in rehab.ERLING HAALAND (Norway)The 22-year-old Haaland has had a phenomenal start in his first season at Manchester City with 17 goals in his first 11 Premier League appearances, but Norway failed to beat the Netherlands in the team's final qualifying game in Group G. Haaland, who had scored in the 1-1 draw when they met in Oslo, missed the decisive game because of an injury. The Dutch qualified as group winners with a 2-0 victory, while Norway was left in third place. Haaland has 21 goals in 23 games for Norway but he has to wait until at least 2026 for his country to reach its first World Cup since 1998.MOHAMED SALAH (Egypt)Salah, who won the Golden Boot as the Premier League's top scorer alongside Son Heung-min last season, missed a penalty against Senegal in the shootout that eliminated Egypt from the World Cup playoffs. Salah blasted his attempt over the crossbar and former Liverpool teammate Sadio Mane kicked the winner for his team's 3-1 victory. It was a repeat of Senegal's win on penalties in the African Cup of Nations final the month before. This season, Salah has scored four goals in his first 12 matches as Liverpool has struggled for wins.PAUL POGBA (France)France has also lost Paul Pogba, who was ruled out of the tournament because of ongoing right knee problems. The 29-year-old Pogba played a vital part in France's World Cup success four years ago, but has yet to play a game this season since his last official match in April. After returning to Juventus from Manchester United in the offseason, Pogba tore his meniscus during the Italian club's preseason tour of the United States in July. He initially decided against having an operation, but then had surgery on his right knee in early September. Pogba's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, said Monday that he \"needs more rehabilitation after his operation.\" Pogba has also been mired in an extortion scandal involving his older brother and childhood friends.N'GOLO KANTE (France)Kante hasn't played for his club or his country since August, and Chelsea confirmed last month that the midfielder will miss the tournament while recovering from surgery on a hamstring injury. Widely regarded as one of the world's best midfielders, Kante played a key role alongside Pogba in France's run to the 2018 title. Another France midfielder, Boubacar Kamara, was already ruled out because of injury.DAVID ALABA (Austria)Austria didn't qualify for the World Cup after losing to Wales in the playoffs. Gareth Bale scored two goals in the 2-1 victory that ended his Real Madrid teammate's hopes of appearing at soccer's biggest tournament for the first time. The 30-year-old Alaba, who joined Madrid from Bayern Munich in 2021, captained Austria at last year's European Championship, where the team lost to eventual champion Italy in the round of 16.LUIS DIAZ (Colombia)Diaz's World Cup hopes were over even before he injured his knee while playing for Liverpool because Colombia finished sixth in South American qualifying. The 25-year-old Diaz, who instantly became a Liverpool favorite after his transfer from Porto in January, still hasn't played at a World Cup. He has scored eight goals in 37 appearances for Colombia. James Rodriguez and \"El Tigre\" Radamel Falcao will also miss the tournament.GIANLUIGI DONNARUMMA (Italy)Arguably the best goalkeeper in the world won't be at the World Cup after Italy surprisingly failed to qualify for the tournament -- again. Donnarumma was the player of the tournament when he helped Italy win Euro 2020, but he was unable to stop Aleksandar Trajkovski's injury-time winner for North Macedonia in the World Cup playoffs in March. Italy also failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Donnarumma, considered the heir to the great Gianluigi Buffon, will get his chance again. Despite already making 49 appearances for Italy, he's only 23 years old.DIOGO JOTA (Portugal)Jota said \"one of my dreams collapsed\" when it was confirmed he will miss the World Cup with a calf injury sustained in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Manchester City on Oct. 16.

All Rights Reserved.FILE - The then Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak arrives for a speech at the COP26 U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, Wednesday, Nov. 3, 2021. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has reversed an earlier decision not to attend the U.N. climate summit in Egypt. Sunak's office previously said he had to skip the talks which start on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022 because of \"pressing domestic commitments\" including the closely-watched government budget statement, expected to be announced on Nov. 17. (AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali, File)LONDON (AP) -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday said he will attend this month's U.N. climate summit in Egypt, reversing a decision to skip it that had drawn criticism at home and abroad.Sunak's office previously said he had to skip the gathering, known as COP27, which start on Sunday. It cited \"pressing domestic commitments,\" including preparations for a major government budget statement scheduled for Nov. 17.But Sunak tweeted Wednesday that he would attend the two-week gathering because \"there is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change.\"\"There is no energy security without investing in renewables,\" he wrote. Sunak's earlier decision to skip the talks were criticized by many, including British government climate adviser Alok Sharma, who will hand over presidency of the Conference of the Parties, or COP, at the summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The U.K. hosted last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.Sunak's about-face came the day after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed he will be going to the climate talks at the invitation of the host country. Under Johnson, who left office in September, the U.K. committed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to eliminate coal from its energy mix by 2024.Environmentalists worry there could be backsliding on those commitments because of the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The opposition Labour Party's climate spokesman, Ed Miliband, said Sunak had been \"shamed into going to COP27.\" \"His initial instinct tells us about all about him: he just doesn't get it when it comes to the energy bills and climate crisis,\" Miliband said.Green Party lawmaker Caroline Lucas said Sunak's initial decision and subsequent U-turn was \"an embarrassing misstep on the world stage.\"\"Let this be a lesson to him -- climate leadership matters,\" she tweeted.Follow AP's climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environmentCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ian Walton)Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo controls the ball during the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester United and West Ham United at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/Jon Super)A look at what's happening in the final round of group games in the Europa League and Europa Conference League on Thursday:Only teams who finish in first place in the eight groups qualify directly to the last 16 and four teams have done that: Real Betis, Union Saint-Gilloise, Freiburg and Ferencvaros. Manchester United and Arsenal are the biggest names in the competition and head into the final round of games looking to seal top spot in their groups. Arsenal has the easier task, with the Premier League leaders just needing to beat Zurich at home to guarantee first place ahead of PSV Eindhoven. PSV, two points behind Arsenal in second place, visits Bodo/Glimt. United trails Real Sociedad in their group -- with both teams certain of a top-two finish -- and they meet in Spain. Having lost 1-0 at home to Sociedad at the start of group play, United needs to win by two goals or more to finish group winner. Fenerbahce and Rennes are way clear in Group B and level on points ahead of games against Dynamo Kyiv and AEK Larnaca, respectively. Group F is the tightest with all four teams -- Lazio, Sturm Graz, Feyenoord and FC Midtjylland -- having the possibility to advance.West Ham has already won its group and can now aim to be the first team to win all six group stage games since the Europa Conference League was launched last season. Manager David Moyes could opt to rest some key players for the game at Romanian club FCSB, which cannot advance. Cologne and Nice face off in their final game in Group D, with the winner assured of advancing. Fiorentina takes on Latvian team RFS aiming to win its group, but will need Istanbul Basaksehir to drop points against Hearts. Group C winner Villarreal plays Lech Poznan. Group winners go directly to the last 16, and second-place teams go into a playoff against the clubs placing third in Europa League groups.More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

As bereaved families and friends struggle to make sense of a Halloween crowd crush that killed 156 people in South Korea's capital, their grief is mixed with anger about officials' failure to employ crowd controls in a small nightlife district jammed with tens of thousands of partiers. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File)SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- As bereaved families and friends struggle to make sense of a Halloween crowd crush that killed 156 people in South Korea's capital, their grief is mixed with anger about officials' failure to employ crowd controls in a small nightlife district jammed with tens of thousands of partiers.Many expressed wrenching pain and deep frustration about what they saw as official ineptitude, including a failure by police to adequately respond to repeated emergency calls from people about the swelling crowd getting out of control hours before the crush occurred Saturday evening in a narrow alley near the Hamilton Hotel in the Itaewon entertainment district. Here are the stories of some of the grieving family members and friends. \"Let's go, let's go,\" Han Gyu-chang, wearing heavy Halloween makeup and a ninja headband, wrote on Facebook as he posted a selfie with two of his closest friends as they headed to Itaewon in a car. He added, \"We're too old for this silliness.\"The 32-year-old didn't survive.One of the friends of 15 years, Choi Young-gyu, described how they were swept up and separated by a wave of bodies pushing forward in the alley between a row of storefronts and the Hamilton Hotel, before people started falling like dominos.\"We were just there for like 20, 30 minutes and all that happened,\" Choi told The Associated Press, his voice cracking. Crushed by layers of falling bodies and desperately fighting for air, Choi said he closed his eyes thinking he was about to die before emergency workers and others pulled him out at the last minute. The other friend was rescued by another partier who managed to pull him into a basement club among the row of storefronts. Hours later, the friend called Choi, crying, after discovering Han was among the rows of lifeless bodies laid out on the streets.\"He was so excited to go to a Halloween celebration, because he never did before,\" Choi said of Han.Choi is receiving medical treatment for various injuries, including a foot that has \"swollen like an elephant,\" he said. The other friend hurt his back.Grappling with shock and grief, Choi said he is having trouble sleeping. \"Everything is too horrible and everything is too fresh. I mean, I saw corpses rolled out in the streets,\" he said. Choi wonders how many police officers it would have taken to prevent the crush. He struggles to understand why officials didn't plan crowd controls and ignored emergency calls. \"I lost a friend, and I want to see someone held accountable,\" he said. At a hospital funeral hall in western Seoul, Lee Hyeon-jik performed his role as the \"sangju,\" the chief family member organizing a funeral, receiving a continuing flow of guests bowing to his late brother's portrait and serving them food at an adjacent dining hall.The tables were packed with dozens of middle-aged workers -- many wearing workshop jackets and vests with plastic nametags -- chatting about work, life and teenage children who no longer talked to them. They were doing their own part in Korean tradition to keep funerals busy and noisy so that bereaved relatives aren't overwhelmed by grief.\"What could be said about him?\" Lee said about his brother, Lee Jeong-hwan, a 49-year-old electronics repairman who was among the oldest victims of the crush in Itaewon. \"He was the most common company employee.\"Lee Jeong-hwan worked for a Samsung Electronics affiliate that repairs and maintains devices like TVs, computers, washing machines and cellphones. The guests remembered him as a personable and hardworking colleague who was passionate about union activities. Lee Hyeon-jik said he didn't learn about his brother's death until Sunday, the day after the tragedy, when the company called to ask whether he had been able to contact his brother. He reached out to police, who confirmed that his brother was killed near the Hamilton Hotel. Emergency workers had administered CPR to him as he lay unconscious, but he was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Lee Hyeon-jik avoided any specific criticism when asked about the lack of crowd control, saying his focus was on giving his brother a proper funeral. Steven Tomas Blesi wanted to travel and experience adventure, so he was excited to spend a semester in South Korea as a junior majoring in international business at Georgia's Kennesaw State University, according to his father, Steve Blesi. During his first two months, he hiked to see waterfalls and a volcano on Jeju Island. He sent his family a video from the island showing the sun and waves.Blesi recalled how his son would dash off on his own as a child when the family visited stores, prompting the older Blesi to joke that they were going to have to put a leash on him.\"That was our boy. He wanted to explore and just get out there,\" Blesi said in a phone interview. Steven Blesi, 20, was among 26 foreign nationals who died in the crush. He had told his father he was going out with friends after finishing midterms. When the family learned about the crowd surge, they frantically called his phone. A police officer eventually answered and said the phone had been recovered from the area.Blesi said he was furious because police appeared to have done nothing to manage the crowd though it was expected to be big after the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions.\"In my opinion, it could have been avoided,\" he said.Blesi picked up his older son from Auburn University and brought him home to be with the family. The two brothers were best friends growing up.\"We're just numb and devastated to be honest with you,\" he said. \"I have no idea how we're going to press forward, but we have our other son who is 21, and we owe it to him to do so. And we owe it to Steven's memory too.\"Nathan Taverniti, a 24-year-old Australian tourist, painfully recalled how the outstretched hands of his desperate friend disappeared into the surging crowd as people began screaming and piling up.\"There were just too many people,\" he said. Grace Rached, a Sydney-based film production assistant, was the lone Australian killed in the crush. \"We are missing our gorgeous angel Grace, who lit up the room with her infectious smile,\" her family said in a statement.Taverniti, like many other survivors, blamed the huge loss of life on what he sees as official ineptitude. He said he cried all day after finding Rached's body at a facility where unidentified victims were kept. \"If the government knows that there were going to be that many people there, and there is going to be road blockages, these should be enough police and emergency services already there on standby,\" he said. \"There was clearly not enough police presence.\"Most of the families of the victims completed the traditional third-day funeral procession on Wednesday, dressed in black and carrying the portrait and remains of their loved ones to crematories and cemeteries. The Seoul City government instructed crematories to burn more bodies per day as part of plans to support the funeral proceedings.The street in front of the narrow alley is now covered with rows of white flowers and notes expressing sorrow. Seoul has also established memorial altars in multiple places that have been visited by tens of thousands. One of the people visiting the altar in front of Seoul City Hall was Hwang Jang Seop, who said he lost both of his grandchildren. \"My grandson and granddaughter said they would go to Itaewon on Saturday. I asked them why they were going, and they said there was a festival there,\" he said. \"I feel so sorry as a grandfather, not able to do anything.\"AP journalists Chisato Tanaka in Seoul, South Korea, and Sudhin Thanawala in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The world's biggest container shipping company Maersk on Wednesday reported substantially improved third-quarter profit and sales on the back of higher ocean freight rates and acquisitions but warned that there were \"dark clouds on the horizon\" in the business. The Copenhagen-based company said profit before taxes stood at 9.5 billion in the July-September period in comparison to 5.9 billion a year earlier. Revenue increased 37 to 22.8 billion, boosted by higher freight rates in the company's main Ocean business unit and acquisitions completed in the Logistics unit.Maersk said that \"it is clear that freight rates have peaked and started to normalize during the quarter, driven by both decreasing demand and easing of supply chain congestion\" and reiterated that earnings in its Ocean unit would come down \"in the coming periods.\"The company's chief executive, Soren Skou, gave a bleak outlook for the future.\"With the war in Ukraine, an energy crisis in Europe, high inflation, and a looming global recession there are plenty of dark clouds on the horizon,\" Skou said in a statement. \"This weighs on consumer purchasing power which in turn impacts global transportation and logistics demand.\"Demand for logistics services moderated across global supply chains in the third quarter, Maersk said, noting that \"supply-side bottlenecks\" continued to be a challenge, but \"there are signs of easing as demand slows and COVID 19-related restrictions in China diminish.\"Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.
